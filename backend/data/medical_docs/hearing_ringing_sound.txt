Hearing ringing sound is a common medical symptom that can be caused by a variety of conditions.

What causes hearing ringing sound?
- Age-related hearing loss. Your brain is used to a certain level of sound stimulation. As a result, your hearing nerve is used to a certain level of activity. When hearing loss occurs, your brain receives less stimulation, but your hearing nerve may still fire at the rate it always has. This can cause you to hear sounds that arenâ€™t really there. About 1 in 3 adults over age 65 develop ringing in their ears.
- Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Exposure to loud noises can cause hearing loss and tinnitus. This can happen over time or from a single incident, like an explosion or close-range gunshot.
- Ear injuries and trauma. These injuries may affect nerves or areas of your brain that help you hear. People who get tinnitus after an injury usually only have ringing in one ear.
- Ear conditions. Earwax blockages or ear infections can cause temporary hearing loss, resulting in ear ringing.
- Medications. Certain drugs can cause tinnitus, including some antibiotics, antidepressants, cancer drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
