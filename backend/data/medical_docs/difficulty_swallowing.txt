Difficulty swallowing(Dysphagia) is a common medical symptom that can be caused by a variety of conditions.

What causes difficulty swallowing?
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): A condition that weakens the nerves that control your muscles.
- Brain tumors: Growths in your brain (both cancerous and benign) that can disrupt the nerve signals that tell your muscles to move.
- Cerebral palsy: A developmental disorder (one you’re born with) that makes it hard to move and coordinate muscles.
- Achalasia: A rare disorder where muscles at the bottom of your esophagus don’t relax to allow food to enter your stomach.
- Cricopharyngeal spasms: Spasms (abnormal contractions) that happen when the muscle at the top of your esophagus squeezes too much, creating the sensation that something’s stuck in your throat.
- Esophageal spasms. Spasms that happen when various muscles in your esophagus squeeze too much.
- Cancer: Tumors in your head and neck can obstruct food and drink. Esophageal cancer is the most common type of cancer that causes dysphagia.
