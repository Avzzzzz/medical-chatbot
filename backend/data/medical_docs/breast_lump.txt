Breast lump is a common medical symptom that can be caused by a variety of conditions.

What causes breast lump?
- Fibrocystic changes: Tiny, fluid-filled sacs and fibrous (rubbery) tissue can feel like a lump.
- Breast cysts: Fluid-filled sacs can form when fluid becomes trapped in your milk ducts. Cysts are common in people who haven’t experienced menopause.
- Fibroadenomas: This benign (noncancerous) lump is the most common breast tumor in younger women (in their 20s and 30s). Your provider may recommend ultrasounds and clinical exams to check on fibroadenomas.
- Phyllodes tumor: A tumor that occurs in your breast’s connective tissue.
- Breast calcifications: Very large benign calcium deposits (usually following a breast reduction or tissue flap procedure) can feel like a large hard lump.
- Breast infection: An infection in the breast tissue can cause a localized area of hardened tissue. A breast abscess can also form (a firm, discrete lump filled with pus due to infection).
- Breast cancer: A tumor growing in the breast tissue causes a lump.
