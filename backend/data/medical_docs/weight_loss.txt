Weight loss is a common medical symptom that can be caused by a variety of conditions.

What causes weight loss?
- Addison’s disease: This can cause unintentional weight loss because low levels of cortisol and aldosterone affect your metabolism. Other symptoms include chronic diarrhea, loss of appetite and nausea and vomiting.
- AIDS: Late-stage AIDS often leads to rapid weight loss due to changes in metabolism and diarrhea.
- Cancer: In cancer, changes in metabolism or appetite can lead to unexplained weight loss.
- Celiac disease: Some people with celiac disease lose weight because their intestines can’t absorb all the nutrients from food. Celiac symptoms also include diarrhea and vomiting.
- Crohn’s disease: This inflammation of your bowels or colon can make you lose your appetite and lead to chronic diarrhea.
- Dementia: People with advanced dementia can experience problems that lead to weight loss, like dental problems, trouble swallowing (dysphagia), forgetting to eat regularly and loss of appetite.
- Dental health issues: If you have trouble chewing, you may eat less than your body needs. Cavities, gum disease, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders and toothaches can lead to unexplained weight loss.
- Diabetes: When your cells don’t have enough glucose, your body starts burning muscle and fat cells for energy. This can happen if you have undiagnosed diabetes, or if your medications aren’t managing your symptoms well.
- Eating disorders: Unexplained weight loss may be an early symptom of undiagnosed eating disorders like anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.
- Heart failure: This can cause weight loss, especially in the later stages.
- Hyperthyroidism: This condition speeds up your metabolism and can lead to weight loss.
- Mental health conditions: You may have appetite changes with depression and anxiety, like little to no desire to eat.
- Medications: Sometimes, medications can cause issues such as altered taste or smell, decreased desire to eat, dry mouth, issues with swallowing, or nausea and vomiting that can contribute to weight loss over time.
- Parasitic infection: The diarrhea and vomiting from parasitic infections can lead to weight loss.
- Pancreatitis: If you have pancreatitis that doesn’t go away and gets worse over time (chronic), you may lose your appetite.
- Parkinson’s disease: Weight loss may occur because of other Parkinson’s disease symptoms, including loss of smell (anosmia), depression, trouble swallowing, loss of appetite, nausea and trouble feeding yourself due to lack of muscle control.
- Peptic ulcer: Symptoms of loss of appetite and nausea and vomiting can lead to weight loss.
- Prescription medications: Some medications cause weight loss as a side effect.
- Ulcerative colitis: Symptoms of ulcerative colitis like diarrhea, nausea and loss of appetite can lead to weight loss.
- Substance use disorder: Using substances like drugs and alcohol can change your appetite, lead to nausea and vomiting, and eventually may cause liver damage.
