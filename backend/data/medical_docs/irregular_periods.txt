Irregular periods is a common medical symptom that can be caused by a variety of conditions.

What causes irregular periods?
- Endometriosis: Endometriosis occurs when endometrial tissue grows outside of your uterus. The tissue often attaches itself to your ovaries or fallopian tubes. Endometriosis may cause abnormal bleeding, cramps or severe pain before and during your period.
- Pelvic inflammatory disease: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a bacterial infection that affects the female reproductive system. It’s typically caused by an untreated sexually transmitted infection (STI). Bacteria enter your vagina and spread to your uterus and upper genital tract. Symptoms of PID include a heavy vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor, irregular periods and pelvic pain.
- Polycystic ovary syndrome: In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), your ovaries make large amounts of androgens, which are a type of hormone. This hormone prevents or delays ovulation, causing irregular periods. People with PCOS may stop menstruating completely.
- Primary ovarian insufficiency: This condition occurs in women under age 40 whose ovaries don’t function as they should, causing missed or irregular periods. It can occur during treatment for cancer with chemotherapy and radiation or if you have certain autoimmune conditions.
- Thyroid or pituitary gland disorders: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and other thyroid or pituitary gland disorders affect your hormones. This causes your period to be irregular.
- Bleeding disorders: You may experience heavy menstrual bleeding if you develop a bleeding or blood clotting disorder.
- Uterine cancer or ovarian cancer: Certain cancers can affect a person’s menstrual period. Changes may include bleeding that’s heavier than usual or missed periods
- Birth control pills: Most birth control pills contain a combination of hormones. The pills prevent pregnancy by keeping your ovaries from releasing eggs. Going on or off birth control pills can affect menstruation. You may have irregular or missed periods for up to six months after discontinuing birth control pills.
- Medications, like steroids or anticoagulant drugs (blood thinners).
- Miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy (the fertilized egg implants outside your uterus).
- Surgery, scarring or blockages in your uterus, ovaries or fallopian tubes.
