Definition
The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test is a blood test
that is performed during pregnancy. This screening
test measures the level of AFP in the mother’s blood
and indicates the probability that the fetus has one
of several serious birth defects. The level of AFP can
also be determined by analyzing a sample of amniotic
fluid. This screening test cannot diagnose a specific
condition; it only indicates increased risk for several
birth defects. Outside pregnancy, the AFP test is used
to detect liver disease, certain cancerous tumors, and
to monitor the progress of cancer treatment.
Purpose
Alpha-fetoprotein is a substance produced by the
liver of a fetus. The exact function of this protein is
unknown. After birth, the infant’s liver stops producing
AFP, and an adult liver contains only trace amounts.
During pregnancy, the fetus excretes AFP in urine and
some of the protein crosses the fetal membranes to
enter the mother’s blood. The level of AFP can then
be determined by analyzing a sample of the mother’s
blood. By analyzing the amount of AFP found in a
blood or amniotic fluid sample, doctors can determine
the probability that the fetus is at risk for certain birth
defects. It is very important that the doctor know
precisely how old the fetus is when the test is performed
since the AFP level changes over the length of the
pregnancy. Alone, AFP screening cannot diagnose a
birth defect. The test is used as an indicator of risk and
then an appropriate line of testing (such as amniocentesis or ultrasound) follows, based on the results.
Abnormally high AFP may indicate that the
fetus has an increased risk of a neural tube defect,
the most common and severe type of disorder
associated with increased AFP. These types of defects
include spinal column defects (spina bifida) and
anencephaly (a severe and usually fatal brain
abnormality). If the tube that becomes the brain
and spinal cord does not close correctly during fetal
development, AFP may leak through this abnormal
opening and enter the amniotic fluid. This leakage
creates abnormally high levels of AFP in amniotic
fluid and in maternal blood. If the screening test
indicates abnormally high AFP, ultrasound is used
to diagnose the problem.
Other fetal conditions that can raise AFP levels
above normal include:

cysts at the end of the spine

blockage in the esophagus or intestines

liver disease causing liver cells to die

defects in the abdominal wall

kidney or urinary tract defects or disease

brittle bone disease
Levels may also be high if there is too little fluid in
the amniotic sac around the fetus, more than one
developing fetus, or a pregnancy that is farther along
than estimated.
For unknown reasons, abnormally low AFP may
indicate that the fetus has an increased risk of Down
syndrome. Down syndrome is a condition that includes
mental retardation and a distinctive physical appearance
linked to an abnormality of chromosome 21 (called
trisomy 21). If the screening test indicates an abnormally
low AFP, amniocentesis is used to diagnose the problem.
Abnormally low levels of AFP can also occur when
the fetus has died or when the mother is overweight.
AFP is often part of a ‘‘triple check’’ blood test
that analyzes three substances as risk indicators of
possible birth defects: AFP, estriol, and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). When all three substances
are measured in the mother’s blood, the accuracy of
the test results increases.
In 2004, a new study showed that the risk of an
infant’s death from sudden infant death syndrome
(SIDS) increased if levels of AFP were higher during
the second trimester of the mother’s pregnancy.
Although AFP in human blood gradually disappears after birth, it never disappears entirely. It may
reappear in liver disease, or tumors of the liver, ovaries, or testicles. The AFP test is used to screen people
at high risk for these conditions. After a cancerous
tumor is removed, an AFP test can monitor the
progress of treatment. Continued high AFP levels
suggest the cancer is growing.
Precautions
It is very important that the doctor know precisely
how old the fetus is when the test is performed since
the AFP level considered normal changes over the
length of the pregnancy. Errors in determining the
age of the fetus lead to errors when interpreting
the test results. Since an AFP test is only a screening
tool, more specific tests must follow to make an accurate diagnosis. An abnormal test result does not necessarily mean that the fetus has a birth defect. The test
has a high rate of abnormal results (either high or low)
to prevent missing a fetus that has a serious condition.
Description
The AFP test is usually performed at week 16 of
pregnancy. Blood is drawn from the patient’s
(mother’s) vein, usually on the inside of the elbow.
AFP can also be measured in the sample of amniotic
fluid taken at the time of amniocentesis. Test results
are usually available after about one week.
Preparation
There is no specific physical preparation for the
AFP test.
Aftercare
There is no specific aftercare involved with this
screening test.
Risks
The risks associated with drawing blood are minimal, but may include bleeding from the puncture
site, feeling faint or lightheaded after the blood is
drawn, or blood accumulating under the puncture
site (hematoma).
Normal results
Alpha-fetoprotein is measured in nanograms per
milliliter (ng/mL) and is expressed as a probability.
The probability (1:100, for example) translates into
the chance that the fetus has a defect (a one in 100
chance, for example).
When testing for cancer or liver diseases, AFP
results are reported as nanograms per milliliter. An
AFP level less than or equal to 50 ng/mL is considered
normal.
Abnormal results
The doctor will inform the woman of her specific
increased risk as compared to the ‘‘normal’’ risk of a
standard case. If the risk of Down syndrome is greater
than the standard risk for women who are 35 years old
or older (one in 270), amniocentesis is recommended.
Again, the test has a high rate of showing an abnormal
AFP level in order to prevent missing a fetus that has
Down’s syndrome. This screening test only predicts
risk; appropriate diagnostic testing will follow after an
abnormal screening result.
In tumor or liver disease testing, an AFP level
greater than 50 ng/mL is considered abnormal.
