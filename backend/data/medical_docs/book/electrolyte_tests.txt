Definition
Electrolytes are positively and negatively charged
molecules, called ions, that are found within cells,
between cells, in the bloodstream, and in other fluids
throughout the body. Electrolytes with a positive
charge include sodium, potassium, calcium, and
magnesium; the negative ions are chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphate. The concentrations of these ions
in the bloodstream remain fairly constant throughout
the day in a healthy person. Changes in the concentration of one or more of these ions can occur during
various acute and chronic disease states and can lead
to serious consequences.
Purpose
Tests that measure the concentration of electrolytes
are useful in the emergency room and to obtain clues for
the diagnosis of specific diseases. Electrolyte tests are
used for diagnosing dietary deficiencies, excess loss of
nutrients due to urination, vomiting, and diarrhea, or
abnormal shifts in the location of an electrolyte within
the body. When an abnormal electrolyte value is
detected, the physician may either act to immediately
correct the imbalance directly (in the case of an emergency) or run further tests to determine the underlying
cause of the abnormal electrolyte value. Electrolyte disturbances can occur with malfunctioning of the kidney
(renal failure), infections that produce severe and
continual diarrhea or vomiting, drugs that cause loss of
electrolytes in the urine (diuretics), poisoning due to accidental consumption of electrolytes, or diseases involving
hormones that regulate electrolyte concentrations.
Precautions
Electrolyte tests are performed from routine
blood tests. The techniques are simple, automated,
and fairly uniform throughout the United States.
During the preparation of blood plasma or serum,
health workers must take care not to break the red
blood cells, especially when testing for serum potassium. Because the concentration of potassium within
red blood cells is much higher than in the surrounding
plasma or serum, broken cells would cause falsely
elevated potassium levels.
Description
Electrolyte tests are typically conducted on blood
plasma or serum, urine, and diarrheal fluids.
Electrolytes can be classified in at least five different
ways. One way is that some electrolytes tend to exist
mostly inside cells, or are intracellular, while others
tend to be outside cells, or are extracellular.
Potassium, phosphate, and magnesium occur at
much greater levels inside the cell than outside, while
sodium and chloride occur at much greater levels
extracellularly. A second classification distinguishes
those electrolytes that participate directly in the transmission of nerve impulses and those that do not.
Sodium, potassium, and calcium are the important
electrolytes involved in nerve impulses, and disorders
affecting them are most closely associated with neurological disorders. A third classification focuses on
electrolytes that are able to form a tight union, or
complex, with one another. Calcium and phosphate
have the greatest tendency to form complexes with
each other. Disorders that cause an increase in either
plasma calcium or phosphate can result in the deposit
of calcium-phosphate crystals in the soft tissues of the
body. A fourth classification concerns those electrolytes that influence the acidity or alkalinity of the
bloodstream, also known as the pH. The pH of the
bloodstream is normally in the range of 7.35–7.45. A
decrease below this range is called acidosis, while a pH
above this range is called alkalosis. The electrolytes
most closely associated with the pH of the bloodstream are bicarbonate, chloride, and phosphate.
Preparation
All electrolyte tests can be performed on plasma
or serum. Plasma is prepared by withdrawing a blood
sample and placing it in a test tube containing a chemical that prevents blood from clotting (an anticoagulant). Serum is prepared by withdrawing a blood
sample, placing it in a test tube, and allowing it to clot.
The blood spontaneously clots within a minute of
withdrawing the blood from a vein. The serum or
plasma is then rapidly spun with a centrifuge in order
to remove the blood cells or clot.
Normal results
Electrolyte concentrations are similar whether
measured in serum or plasma. Values can be
expressed in terms of weight per unit volume (mg/
deciliter; mg/dL) or in the number of molecules in a
volume, or molarity (moles or millimoles/liter; M or
mM). The range of normal values sometimes varies
slightly between different age groups, for males
and females, and between different analytical
laboratories.
The normal level of serum sodium is in the range
of 136–145 mM. The normal levels of serum potassium are 3.5–5.0 mM. Note that sodium occurs at
a much higher concentration than potassium. The
normal concentration of total serum calcium
(bound calcium plus free calcium) is in the range of
8.8–10.4 mg/dL. About 40% of the total calcium in the
plasma is loosely bound to proteins; this calcium is
referred to as bound calcium. The normal range of free
calcium is 4.8–5.2 mg/dL. The normal concentration
of serum magnesium is in the range of 2.0–3.0 mg/dL.
The normal concentration range of chloride is
350–375 mg/dL or 98–106 mM. The normal level of
phosphate, as expressed as the concentration of phosphorus, is 2.0–4.3 mg/dL. Bicarbonate is an electrolyte
that is freely and spontaneously interconvertable with
carbonic acid and carbon dioxide. The normal concentration of carbonic acid (H2CO3) is about 1.35
mM. The normal concentration of bicarbonate
(HCO3
–
) is about 27 mM. The concentration of
total carbon dioxide is the sum of carbonic acid
and bicarbonate; this sum is normally in the range of
26–28 mM. The ratio of bicarbonate/carbonic acid is
more significant than the actual concentrations of
these two forms of carbon dioxide. Its normal value
is 27/1.35 (equivalent to 20/1).
Abnormal results
Positively charged electrolytes
High serum sodium levels (hypernatremia) occur
at sodium concentrations over 145 mM, with severe
hypernatremia over 152 mM. Hypernatremia is
usually caused by diseases that cause excessive urination. In these cases, water is lost, but sodium is still
retained in the body. The symptoms include confusion
and can lead to convulsions and coma. Low serum
sodium levels (hyponatremia) are below 130 mM,
with severe hyponatremia at or below 125 mM.
Hyponatremia often occurs with severe diarrhea,
with losses of both water and sodium, but with sodium
loss exceeding water loss. Hyponatremia provokes
clinical problems only if serum sodium falls below
125 mM, especially if this has occurred rapidly. The
symptoms can be as mild as tiredness but may lead to
convulsions and coma.
High serum potassium (hyperkalemia) occurs at
potassium levels above 5.0 mM; it is considered severe
over 8.0 mM. Hyperkalemia is relatively uncommon,
but sometimes occurs in patients with kidney failure
who take potassium supplements. Hyperkalemia can
result in abnormal beating of the heart (cardiac
arrhythmias). Low serum potassium (hypokalemia)
occurs when serum potassium falls below 3.0 mM. It
can result from low dietary potassium, as during starvation or in patients with anorexia nervosa; from
excessive losses via the kidneys, as caused by diuretic
drugs; or by diseases of the adrenal or pituitary glands.
Mild hypokalemia causes muscle weakness, while
severe hypokalemia can cause paralysis, the inability
to breathe, and cardiac arrhythmias.
High levels of calcium ions (hypercalcemia) occur
at free calcium ion concentrations over 5.2 mg/dL
or total serum calcium above 10.4 mg/dL.
Hypercalcemia usually occurs when the body dissolves
bone at an abnormally fast rate, increasing both serum
calcium and serum phosphate. Sudden hypercalcemia
can cause vomiting and coma, while prolonged and
moderate hypercalcemia results in the deposit of calcium phosphate crystals in the kidneys and eye.
Hypocalcemia occurs when serum free calcium ions
fall below 4.4 mg/dL, or when total serum calcium
falls below 8.8 mg/dL. Hypocalcemia can result from
hypoparathyroidism (low parathyroid hormone), from
failure to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, from low
levels of plasma magnesium, and from phosphate poisoning (the phosphate enters the bloodstream and
forms a complex with the free serum calcium).
Hypocalcemia can cause depression and muscle
spasms.
Hypermagnesemia occurs at serum magnesium
levels over 25 mM (60 mg/dL). Hypermagnesemia is
rare but can occur with the excessive consumption of
magnesium salts. Hypomagnesemia occurs when
serum magnesium levels fall below 0.8 mM, and can
result from poor nutrition. Chronic alcoholism is the
most common cause of hypomagnesemia, in part
because of poor diet. Magnesium levels below 0.5 mM
(1.2 mg/dL) cause serum calcium levels to decline.
Some of the symptoms of hypomagnesemia, including
twitching and convulsions, actually result from the
concurrent hypocalcemia. Hypomagnesemia can also
result in hypokalemia and thereby cause cardiac
arrhythmias.
Negatively charged electrolytes
Serum chloride levels sometimes increase to
abnormal levels as an undesirable side effect of medical
treatment with sodium chloride or ammonium chloride. The toxicity of chloride results not from the chloride itself, but from the fact that the chloride occurs as
the acid, hydrogen chloride (more commonly known
as hydrochloric acid, or HCl). An overdose of chloride
may cause the accumulation of hydrochloric acid in
the bloodstream, with consequent acidosis. Renal
tubular acidosis, one of many kidney diseases, involves
the failure to release acid into the urine. The acidosis
produces weakness, headache, nausea, and cardiac
arrest. Low plasma chloride leads to the opposite
situation: a decline in the acid content of the bloodstream. This is known as alkalization of the bloodstream, or alkalosis. Hydrochloric acid, originally
from extracellular fluids, can be lost by vomiting. At
its most severe, alkalosis results in paralysis (tetany).
Hyperphosphatemia occurs at serum phosphate
levels above 5 mg/dL. It can result from the failure of
the kidneys to excrete phosphate into the urine, causing phosphate to accumulate in the bloodstream.
Hyperphosphatemia can also be caused by the
impaired action of parathyroid hormone and by phosphate poisoning. Severe hyperphosphatemia can cause
paralysis, convulsions, and cardiac arrest. These
symptoms result because the phosphate, occurring in
elevated levels, complexes with free serum calcium,
resulting in hypocalcemia. Tests for heart function
(an electrocardiogram) and parathyroid hormone
levels are used in the diagnosis of hyperphosphatemia.
Hypophosphatemia occurs if serum phosphorus falls
to 2.0 mg/dL or lower. It often results from a shift of
inorganic phosphate from the bloodstream to various
organs and tissues. This shift can be caused by a rise in
pH (alkalization) of the bloodstream, which can occur
during hyperventilation, a reaction in various disease
states. A shift in phosphate to intracellular tissues may
draw calcium away from the bloodstream via the formation of insoluble calcium phosphate crystals within
cells, with consequent hypocalcemia. Thus, tests for
abnormalities in phosphate metabolism also involve
tests for serum calcium.
Bicarbonate metabolism involves several compounds. When dietary starches, sugars, and fats are
broken down for energy production, carbon dioxide is
created. Much of this carbon dioxide (CO2) spontaneously converts to carbonic acid (H2CO3), and
some of the carbonic acid spontaneously converts
to bicarbonate (HCO3
–
) plus a hydrogen ion (H–
).
Eventually, almost every molecule of carbon dioxide
produced in the body, whether in the form of carbon
dioxide, carbonic acid, or bicarbonate, must convert
back to carbon dioxide in order to leave via the lungs
during normal breathing.
If one holds one’s breath, carbon dioxide cannot
escape from the lungs, but continues to be generated
within the body. This results in an increase in production of carbonic acid. A portion of the carbonic acid
breaks apart (dissociates), causing an increase in
hydrogen ions in the plasma, with a resulting acidosis.
Tests for serum bicarbonate levels are accompanied by
tests for acidosis (pH test). Conversely, when one
breathes too rapidly (hyperventilation), the carbon
dioxide is drawn off from the bloodstream and
expelled in the breath at an increased rate. This results
in an increase in the rate of combination of bicarbonate with hydrogen ions, resulting in alkalosis.
Acidosis and alkalosis can be produced by means
other than by altering the rate of breathing. The carbonic acid and bicarbonate in the bloodstream
minimize (or buffer) any trend to acidosis or alkalosis.
Tests for bicarbonate are generally accompanied by
tests for blood pH and possibly tests for kidney malfunction, abnormal hormone function, or gastrointestinal disorders.
