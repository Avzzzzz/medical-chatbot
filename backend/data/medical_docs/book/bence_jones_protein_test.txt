Definition
 Bence Jones proteins are small proteins (light
 chains of immunoblobulin) found in the urine.
 Testing for these proteins is done to diagnose and
 monitor multiple myeloma and other similar diseases.
 Purpose
 Bence Jones proteins are considered the first
 tumor marker. A tumor marker is a substance, made
 by the body, that is linked to a certain cancer, or
 malignancy. Bence Jones proteins are made by plasma
 cells, a type of white blood cell. The presence of these
 proteins in a person’s urine is associated with a malig
nancy of plasma cells.
 Multiple myeloma, a tumor of plasma cells, is the
 disease most often linked with Bence Jones proteins.

 Other diseases involving cancerous or excessive
 growth of plasma cells or cells similar to plasma cells
 can cause Bence Jones proteins in the urine. These
 diseases include: Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia,
 some lymphomas and leukemias, osteogenic sarcoma,
 cryoglobulinemia, malignant B-cell disease, amyloidosis,
 light chain disease, and cancer that has spread to bone.
 Description
 Urine is the best specimen in which to look for
 Bence Jones proteins. Proteins are usually too large to
 move through a healthy kidney, from the blood into
 the urine. Bence Jones proteins are an exception. They
 are small enough to move quickly and easily through
 the kidney into the urine.
 A routine urinalysis will not detect Bence Jones
 proteins. There are several methods used by labora
tories to detect and measure these proteins. The classic
 Bence Jones reaction involves heating urine to 1408F
 (608C). At this temperature, the Bence Jones proteins
 will clump. The clumping disappears if the urine is
 further heated to boiling and reappears when the
 urine is cooled. Other clumping procedures using
 salts, acids, and other chemicals are also used to detect
 these proteins. These types of test will reveal whether
 or not Bence Jones proteins are present, but not how
 much is present.

 exact amount of Bence Jones proteins. This proce
dure–immunoelectrophoresis–is usually done on
 urine that has been collected for 24-hours.
 The test is covered by insurance when medically
 necessary. Results are usually available within several
 days.
 Preparation
 Urine is usually collected throughout a 24-hour
 time period. A person is given a large container in  which to collect the urine. The urine should be refri
gerated until it is brought to the laboratory or physi
cian’s office.
 Normal results
 Bence Jones proteins normally are not present in
 the urine.
 Abnormal results
 Bence Jones proteins are present in 50–80% of
 people with multiple myeloma. People with other
 malignancies also can have a positive Bence Jones
 proteins test, but less frequently.
 Certain nonmalignant diseases, such as rheuma
toid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and
 chronic renal insufficiency, can have Bence Jones pro
teins in the urine. High doses of penicillin or aspirin
 before collecting the urine can give a false positive
 result.
