Definition
Aldolase is an enzyme found throughout the
body, particularly in muscles. Like all enzymes, it is
needed to trigger specific chemical reactions. Aldolase
helps muscle turn sugar into energy. Testing for aldolase is done to diagnose and monitor skeletal muscle
diseases.
Purpose
Skeletal muscle diseases increase the aldolase level
found in a person’s blood. Skeletal muscles are those
muscles attached to bones and whose contractions
make those bones move. When the muscles are diseased or damaged, such as in muscular dystrophy, the
cells deteriorate and break open. The contents of the
cells, including aldolase, spill into the bloodstream.
Measuring the amount of aldolase in the blood indicates the degree of muscle damage.
As muscles continue to deteriorate, aldolase levels
decrease and eventually fall below normal. Less muscle means fewer cells and less aldolase.
Muscle weakness may be caused by neurologic as
well as muscular problems. The measurement of
aldolase levels can help pinpoint the cause. Aldolase
levels will be normal where muscle weakness is caused
by neurological disease, such as poliomyelitis or
multiple sclerosis, but aldolase levels will be elevated
in cases of muscular disease, such as muscular
dystrophy.
Aldolase is also found in the liver and cardiac
muscle of the heart. Damage or disease to these
organs, such as chronic hepatitis or a heart attack,
will also increase aldolase levels in the blood, but to a
lesser degree.
Description
Aldolase is measured by mixing a person’s serum
with a substance with which aldolase is known to
trigger a reaction. The end product of this reaction is
measured, and, from that measurement, the amount of
aldolase in the person’s serum is determined.
The test is covered by insurance when medically
necessary. Results are usually available the next day.
Preparation
To collect the 5-10 ml of blood needed for this test,
a healthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the patient’s
upper arm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and
inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws
the blood through the needle into an attached tube.
Collection of the sample takes only a few minutes.
The patient should avoid strenuous exercise and
have nothing to eat or drink, except water, for eight to
ten hours before this test.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to
the puncture site until the bleeding stops will reduce
bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve
discomfort.
Normal results
Newborns have the highest normal aldolase levels
and adults the lowest. Normal values will vary based
on the laboratory and the method used.
Abnormal results
As noted, aldolase is elevated in skeletal muscle
diseases, such as muscular dystrophies. Duchenne’s
muscular dystrophy, the most common type of muscular dystrophy, will increase the aldolase level more
than any other disease.
Nondisease conditions that affect the muscle, such
as injury, gangrene, or an infection, can also increase
the aldolase level. Also, strenuous exercise can temporarily increase a person’s aldolase level.
Certain medications can increase the aldolase
level, while others can decrease it. To interpret what
the results of the aldolase test mean, a physician will
evaluate the result, the person’s clinical symptoms,
and other tests that are more specific for muscle
damage and disease.
