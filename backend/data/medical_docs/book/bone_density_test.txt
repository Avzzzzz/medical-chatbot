 Definition
 Abone density test, or scan, is designed to check
 for osteoporosis, a disease that occurs when the bones
 become thin and weak. Osteoporosis happens when
 the bones lose calcium and other minerals that keep
 them strong. Osteoporosis begins after menopause in
 many women, and worsens after age 65, often result
ing in serious fractures. These fractures may not only bring disability, but may affect longevity. As many as
 one-fourth of women who fracture their hip after age
 50 die within one year.
 Most people today will get a bone density scan
 fromamachineusingatechnologycalledDualEnergy
 X-ray Absorptiometry or DEXA for short. This
 machine takes a picture of the bones in the spine,
 hip, total body and wrist, and calculates their density.
 If a DEXA machine is not available, bone density
 scans can also be done with dual photon absorptiome
try (measuring the spine, hip and total body) and
 quantitative computed tomography scans (measuring
 the spine). Bone density scanners that use DEXA tech
nology to just measure bone density in the wrist (called
 pDEXA scans) provide scans at some drugstores. Yet  these tests are not as accurate as those that measure
 density in the total body, spine or hip–where most
 fractures occur.
 Purpose
 A bone density scan measures the strength of an
 individual’s bones and determines the risk of fracture.
 An observation of any osteoporosis present can be
 made.
  Description 
   To take a DEXA bone density scan, the patient
 lies on abedunderneaththescanner,acurvingplastic
 arm that emits x rays. These low-dose x rays form a
 fan beam that rotates around the patient. During the
 test, the scanner moves to capture images of the
 patient’s spine, hip or entire body. A computer then
 compares the patient’s bone strength and risk of
 fracture to that of other people in the United States
 at the same age and to young people at peak bone
 density. Bones reach peak density at age 30 and then
 start to lose mass. The test takes about 20 minutes to
 do andis painless. The DEXA bone scan costs about
 $250. SomeinsurancecompaniesandMedicarecover
 the cost. pDEXA wrist bone scans in drugstores are
 available for about $30.
 Preparation
 The patient puts on a hospital gown and lies
 on the bed underneath the scanner. Not all doctors
 routinely schedule this test. If the following factors
 apply to a patient, they may need a bone density
 scan and can discuss this with their doctor. The
 patient:
 is at risk for osteoporosis
 is near menopause
 has broken a bone after a modest trauma
 has a family history of osteoporosis
 uses steroid or antiseizure medications
 has hadaperiodofrestricted mobility for more than
 six months
 Risks
 The DEXAbonescan exposes the patient to only
 a small amount of radiation–about one-fiftieth that
 of a chest x ray, or about the amount you get from
 taking a cross-country airplane flight. 
  Normal results
 The patient, when compared with people at
 ‘‘young normal bone density’’ (called the T-score)
 has the same or denser bones than a healthy 30-year
old. T scores above1meanthatapatienthasahealthy
 bone mass. Scores from 0 to 1 mean that the patient
 has borderline bone mass and should repeat the test in
 two to five years.
 Abnormal results
 The patient has two to four times the risk of a
 broken bone as other people in the United States at the
 same age and those at peak bone density. If a patient’s T
 score ranges from 1to 2.5 they have low bone mass
 and are at risk for osteoporosis. A T score below 2.5
 means osteoporosis is already evident. These patients
 should have a repeat bone density scan every year or two.
