Alternative treatments
There are two herbal remedies that are reported to
be effective as alternative treatments for migraine. One
is feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), an herb related to
the daisy that is traditionally used in England to prevent migraines. Published studies indicate that feverfew can reduce the frequency and intensity of
migraines. It does not, however, relieve pain once the
headache has begun. The other herbal remedy is butterbur root (Petasites hybridus). Petadolex is a natural
preparation made from butterbur root that has been
sold in Germany since the 1970s as a migraine preventive. Petadolex has been available in the United States
since December 1998.
Interactions
Antimigraine drugs may interact with other medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of
the drugs may change, or the risk of side effects may be
greater. Anyone who takes these drugs should let the
physician know all other medicines he or she is taking.
Among the drugs that may interact with antimigraine
drugs are:
 Beta blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal)
 Drugs that tighten blood vessels such as epinephrine
(EpiPen) and pseudoephedrine (Sudafed)
 Nicotine such as cigarettes or Nicoderm, Habitrol,
and other smoking-cessation drugs
 Certain antibiotics, such as erythromycin and clarithromycin (Biaxin)
 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine
(Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate)
 Certain antidepressants, such as sertraline (Zoloft),
fluoxetine (Prozac), and paroxetine (Paxil)
 Fluvoxamine (Luvox), prescribed for obsessive compulsive disorder or chronic pain.
Anticonvulsants should not be taken together
with aspirin, alcohol, or tranquilizers.
Remember naratriptan, sumatriptan, rizatriptan
and zolmitriptan may interact with ergotamine. These
drugs should not be taken within 24 hours of taking
any drug containing ergotamine.
