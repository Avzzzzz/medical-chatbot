 the interaction of multiple body organs and systems
 including the eyes, ears, brain and nervous system, car

 to determine the causes of loss of balance, dizziness,or
 the inability to coordinate movement or activities.
 Purpose
 Tests ofbalanceandcoordination,andtheexam
ination of the organs and systems that influence
 balance and coordination, can help to identify causes
 of dizziness, fainting, falling, or incoordination.
 Precautions
 Tests for balance and coordination should be con
ducted in asafe andcontrolled areawherepatients will
 not experience injury if they become dizzy or fall.
 Description
 Assessment of balance and coordination can
 include discussion of the patient’s medical history and
 acompletephysicalexaminationincludingevaluationof
 the heart, head, eyes, and ears. A slow pulse or heart
 rate, or very low blood pressure may indicate a circula
torysystemproblem,whichcancausedizzinessorfaint
ing. During the examination, the patient may be asked
 to rotate the head from side to side while sitting up or
 while lying down withthe head and neckextendedover
 the edge of the examination table. If these tests produce
 dizziness or a rapid twitching of the eyeballs (nystag
mus), the patient may have a disorder of the inner ear,
 which is responsible for maintaining balance.
 Anexamination oftheeyes andearsmayalsogive
 clues to episodes of dizziness or incoordination. The
 patient may beaskedtofocusonalightoronadistant
 point or object, and to look up, down, left, and right
 moving only the eyes while the eyes are examined.
 Problems with vision may, in themselves, contribute
 to balance and coordination disturbances, or may
 indicate more serious problems of the nervous system
 or brain function. Hearing loss, fluid in the inner ear,
 or ear infection might indicate the cause of balance
 and coordination problems.
 Various physical tests may also be used. A patient
 maybeaskedtowalkastraightline,standononefoot,
 or touch a finger to the nose to help assess balance.
 The patient may be asked to squeeze or push against
 the doctor’s hands, to squat down, to bend over, stand
 ontiptoes or stand ontheir heels. Important aspects of
 these tests include holding positions for a certain number 
 of seconds, successfully repeating movements a
 certain number of times, and repeating the test accu
rately with eyes closed. The patient’s reflexes may also
 be tested. For example, the doctor may tap on the  knees, ankles, andelbowswithasmallrubbermalletto
 test nervous system functioning. These tests may
 reveal muscle weakness or nervous system problems
 that could contribute to incoordination.
 Preparation
 Nospecial preparation is required prior to admin
istration of balance and coordination tests. The
 patient may be asked to disrobe and put on an exam
ination gown to make it easier for the doctor to
 observe muscles and reflex responses.
 Aftercare
 No special aftercare is generally required, however,
 some of the tests may cause episodes of dizziness or
 incoordination. Patients may need to use caution in
 returning to normal activities if they are experiencing
 anysymptomsofdizziness,lightheadedness,orweakness.
 Risks
 Thesesimpletests of balanceandcoordinationare
 generally harmless.
 Normal results
 Undernormal conditions, these test will not cause
 dizziness, loss of balance, or incoordination.
 Abnormal results
 The presence of dizziness, lightheadedness, loss of
 coordination, unusual eye movements, muscle weak
ness, or impaired reflexes are abnormal results and
 may indicate the problem causing the loss of balance
 or incoordination. In some cases, additional testing
 may be needed to diagnose the cause of balance or
 coordination problems.
