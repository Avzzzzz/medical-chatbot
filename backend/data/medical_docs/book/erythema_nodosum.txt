Definition
Erythema nodosum is a skin disorder characterized
by painful red nodules appearing mostly on the shins.
Description
Erythema nodosum is an eruption of tender red
lumps on both shins and occasionally the arms and
face. Bruising often accompanies the nodule formation.
Erythema nodosum is most prevalent in young adults.
Causes and symptoms
Erythema nodosum can be caused by many
important and treatable diseases. Among them are
tuberculosis, several fungal lung infections, leprosy,
inflammatory bowel disease, and some potentially
dangerous bacterial infections. Drugs can also induce
erythema nodosum. The most common are penicillin,
sulfonamides, and birth control pills.
Diagnosis
There are a few other skin eruptions that mimic
erythema nodosum, so the physician may have to perform a biopsy to sort them out. There are a few types
of panniculitis, fat inflammation, that may signal a
cancer somewhere in the body, and there are other
kinds of inflammation that may confuse the diagnosis.
Once the skin problem has been diagnosed, its
underlying cause must then be identified. A lengthy
evaluation may ensue, and often times the cause
remains unknown.
Treatment
Painful nodules can be treated with mild pain killers and local application of ice packs. Medical attention will be directed toward the underlying disease.
The nodules will eventually disappear, leaving no
trace behind.
