Definition
Testing for antimyocardial antibodies is done
when evaluating a person for heart damage or heart
disease.
Purpose
Antimyocardial antibodies are autoantibodies.
Normal antibodies are special proteins built by the
body as a defense against foreign material entering the
body. Autoantibodies are also proteins built by the body,
but instead of attacking foreign material, they inappropriately attack the body’s own cells.Antimyocardial antibodies attack a person’s heart muscle, or myocardium.
This test may be done on a person who recently
had trauma to the heart, such as heart surgery or a
myocardial infarction (heart attack). It also may be
done on someone with heart disease, such as cardiomyopathy or rheumatic fever.
Although the presence of antimyocardial antibodies does not diagnose heart damage or disease, there is
a connection between the presence of these antibodies
and damage to the heart. The amount of damage, however, cannot be predicted by the amount of antibodies.
These antibodies usually appear after heart surgery
or thebeginning of disease, but theymaybepresent before
surgery or the onset of disease. In 30% of people with
myocardial infarction and 70% of people having heart
surgery, antimyocardial antibodies will appear within
two to three weeks and stay for three to eight weeks.
Description
A 5-10 mL sample of venous blood is drawn from
the patient’s arm in the region of the inner elbow.
Antimyocardial antibodies are detected by combining
a patient’s serum (clear, thin, sticky fluid in blood)
with cells from animal heart tissue, usually that of a
monkey. Antimyocardial antibodies in the serum bind
to the heart tissue cells. A fluorescent dye is then added
to the mixture. This dye will attach to any antibodies
and heart tissue cells bound together. The final mixture is studied under a microscope that is designed to
show fluorescence. If fluorescent cells are seen under
the microscope, the test is positive.
When the test is positive, the next step is to find
out how much antibody is present. The patient’s
serum is diluted, or titered, and the test is done
again. The serum is then further diluted and the test
repeated until the serum is so dilute that fluorescence is
no longer seen. The last dilution that showed fluorescence is the titer reported.
Preparation
No fasting or special prepartion is needed. Before
the test is done it should be explained to the patient.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site after the blood is drawn or the person may feel
dizzy or faint. Pressure to the puncture site until the
bleeding stops reduces bruising. Warm packs on the
puncture site relieve discomfort.
Normal results
Antimyocardial antibodies are not normally seen
in healthy individuals.
Abnormal results
A positive result means that antimyocardial antibodies are present and that heart disease or damageislikely.
Further testing may be needed as other autoantibodies
could also be present, causing a false abnormal test.
