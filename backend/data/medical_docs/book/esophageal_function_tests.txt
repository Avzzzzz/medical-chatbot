Definition
The esophagus is the swallowing tube through
which food passes on its way from the mouth to the
stomach. The main function of this organ is to propel
food down into the stomach. There is also a mechanism to prevent food from coming back up or ‘‘refluxing’’ from the stomach into the esophagus.
Esophageal function tests are used to determine if
these processes are normal or abnormal.
Purpose
The esophagus is a long, muscular tube that also
has two muscles (or sphincters) at the top and bottom.
All of these muscular areas must contract in an exact
sequence for swallowing to proceed normally. There
are three main symptoms that occur when esophageal
function is abnormal: difficulty with swallowing (dysphagia), heartburn, and chest pain.
Doctors perform a variety of tests to evaluate
these symptoms. Endoscopy, which is not a test of
esophageal function, is often used to determine if the
lining of the esophagus has any ulcers, tumors, or
areas of narrowing (strictures). Many times, however,
endoscopy only shows the doctor if there is injury to
the esophageal lining, and the procedure gives no
information about the cause of the problem.
Therefore, in addition to endoscopy, several studies are available that measure esophageal function.
There are three basic types of tests used to assess
esophageal function:
 Manometry is used to study the way the muscles of
the esophagus contract, and is most useful for the
investigation of difficulty with swallowing.
 Esophageal pH monitoring measures changes in esophageal acidity, and is valuable for evaluating
patients with heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux
disease (GERD). X-ray studies investigate swallowing difficulties.
They either follow the progress of barium during
swallowing using a fluoroscope, or they use radioactive scanning techniques.
Precautions
Pregnant patients undergoing x-ray exams should
carefully review the risks and benefits with their doctors. Most x-ray exams of the gastrointestinal tract do
not involve radiation levels that are harmful to the
unborn baby.
Description
Manometry
This study is designed to measure the pressure
changes produced by contraction of the muscular portions of the esophagus. An abnormality in the function
of any one of the segments of the swallowing tube
causes difficulty in swallowing. Doctors call this symptom dysphagia. This exam is most useful in evaluating
those patients whose endoscopy is negative.
During manometry, the patient swallows a thin
tube carrying a device that senses changes in pressures
in the esophagus. Readings are taken at rest and during swallowing. Medications are sometimes given during the study to help in the diagnosis. The results are
then transmitted to recording equipment. Manometry
can best identify diseases that produce disturbances of
motility or contractions of the esophagus.
ESOPHAGEAL PH MONITORING. This procedure
involves measuring the esophagus’ exposure to acid
that has ‘‘refluxed’’ from the stomach. The test is ideal
for evaluating recurring heartburn or GERD. Too
much acid produces not only heartburn, but also
ulcers that can bleed or produce areas of narrowing
(strictures) when they heal.
Normally, acid refluxes into the esophagus in only
small amounts for short periods of time. A muscle
called the lower esophageal sphincter prevents excessive reflux. Spontaneous contractions that increase
esophageal emptying and production of saliva are
other important protective mechanisms.
‘‘pH’’ is the scientific term that tells just how acidic
or alkaline a substance is. Researchers have shown that
in the esophagus, the presence of acid is damaging only
if it persists for prolonged periods. Therefore, the test
has been designed to monitor the level of acidity over
24 hours, usually in the home. In this way, patients
maintain their daily routine, documenting their symptoms, and at what point in their activities they
occurred. During this period, a thin tube with a pH
monitor remains in the esophagus to record changes.
After the study, a computer is used to compare changes
in acidity with symptoms reported by the patient.
Surgery is an effective and long-lasting treatment
for symptoms of recurrent reflux and is the choice of
many patients and doctors. pH monitoring is usually
performed before surgery to confirm the diagnosis and
to judge the effects of drug therapy.
X-RAY TESTS. These fall into two categories: (1)
those done with the use of barium and a fluoroscope;
and (2) those performed with radioactive materials.
Studies performed with fluoroscopy are of greatest value in identifying a structural abnormality of the
esophagus. Although this is not truly an esophageal
function test, it does allow doctors to consider other
diagnostic possibilities. Often a sandwich or marshmallow coated with barium is used to identify the site
of an obstruction.
During fluoroscopy, the radiologist can observe
the passage of material through the esophagus in real
time, and video recordings can also be done. This is
particularly useful when the swallowing symptoms
appear to involve mainly the upper region of the esophagus. The most common cause of swallowing difficulties is a previous stroke, although other diseases of
the neuromuscular system (like myasthenia gravis) can
produce the same symptoms.
Scans using low-dose radioactive materials are useful because they are able not only to demonstrate that
food passes through the esophagus more slowly than
normal, but also how slow. These studies involve swallowing food coated with material that is followed by a
nuclear medicine scanner. Scans are best used when
other methods have failed to make a diagnosis, or if it
is necessary to determine the degree of the abnormality.
As of 1997, scans mainly served as research tools.
Preparation
Patients should not eat or drink for several hours
before the exam. Many medications affect the esophagus; doses sometimes need to be adjusted or even
stopped for a while. Patients must inform doctors of
all medications taken, including over-the-counter
medications (purchased without a doctor’s prescription), and any known allergies.
Aftercare
For most of these studies, no special care is needed
after the procedure. Patients can often go about normal daily activities following any of these tests.
One exception is for those who undergo an x-ray
exam with the use of barium. This can have a constipating effect and patients should ask about using a
mild laxative later on.
Risks
Exposure of a fetus to x rays, especially in the first
three months, is a potential risk.
Other studies of esophageal function are essentially
free of any significant risk. The tubes passed during
these procedures are small, and most patients adjust to
them quite well. However, since medications cannot be
used to relax patients, some may not tolerate the exam.
Abnormal results
Manometry is used to diagnose abnormalities
related to contraction or relaxation of the various
muscular regions of the esophagus. These studies cannot distinguish whether injury to either the muscle or
nerves of the esophagus is producing the abnormal
results. Only the final effect on esophageal muscle is
identified. Results should be interpreted in light of the
patient’s entire medical history.
For example, there are many diseases that cause
poor relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter.
When no cause is found, the disease is called achalasia.
Abnormal results of pH tests can confirm symptoms of heartburn or indicate a cause of chest pain
(or rarely, swallowing difficulties). Doctors may want
to start or change medications based on these results,
or even repeat the test using different doses of medication. As noted above, these studies are indicated
before surgical treatment of GERD.
X-ray tests can only serve to document an
abnormality, and they are far from perfect. If they
are negative, then other studies are often needed.
