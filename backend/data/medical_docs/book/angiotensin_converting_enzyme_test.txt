Definition
This test measures blood levels of angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE), also known as Serum
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (SASE). The primary function of ACE is to help regulate arterial
pressure by converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II.
Purpose
The ACE test is used primarily to detect and
monitor the clinical course of sarcoidosis (a disease
that affects many organs, especially the lungs), to differentiate between sarcoidosis and similar diseases, and to
delineate between active and inactive sarcoid disease.
Elevated ACE levels are also found in a number of
other conditions, including Gaucherâ€™s disease (a rare
familial disorder of fat metabolism) and leprosy.
Precautions
It should be noted that people under 20 years of
age normally have very high ACE levels. Decreased
levels may be seen in the condition of excess fat in the
blood (hyperlipidemia). Drugs that may cause
decreased ACE levels include ACE inhibitor antihypertensives and steroids.
Description
ACE plays an important role in the renin/aldosterone mechanism which controls blood pressure by
converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, two proteins involved in regulating blood pressure.
Angiotensin I by itself is inactive, but when converted
by ACE to the active form, angiotensin II, it causes
narrowing of the small blood vessels in tissues, resulting in an increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin II
also stimulates the hormone aldosterone, which causes
an increase in blood pressure. Certain kidney disorders increase the production of angiotensin II, another
cause of hypertension. Despite the action of ACE on
blood pressure regulation, determination of this
enzyme is not very helpful in the evaluation of hypertension (high blood pressure).
Preparation
Determination of ACE levels requires a blood
sample. The patient need not be fasting.
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the puncture site, fainting or
feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma
(blood accumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results
Normal ranges for this test are laboratory-specific
but can range from 8-57 U/ml for patients over
20 years of age.
Abnormal results
Serum ACE levels are elevated in approximately
80-90% of patients with active sarcoidosis. Thyroid hormone may have an effect on ACE activity, as hypothyroid (low thyroid) patients, as well as patients with
anorexia nervosawith associated findings of hypothyroidism, may have low serum ACE activity. ACE can also be
decreased in lung cancer (bronchogenic carcinoma).
