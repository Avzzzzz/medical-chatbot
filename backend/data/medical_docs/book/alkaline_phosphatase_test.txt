Definition
Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme found
throughout the body. Like all enzymes, it is needed,
in small amounts, to trigger specific chemical reactions. When it is present in large amounts, it may
signify bone or liver disease or a tumor.
Purpose
Medical testing of alkaline phosphatase is concerned with the enzyme that is found in liver, bone,
placenta, and intestine. In a healthy liver, fluid containing alkaline phosphate and other substances is
continually drained away through the bile duct. In a
diseased liver, this bile duct is often blocked, keeping
fluid within the liver. Alkaline phosphatase accumulates and eventually escapes into the bloodstream.
The alkaline phosphatase of the liver is produced by
the cells lining the small bile ducts (ductoles) in the liver.
Its origin differs from that of other enzymes called
aminotransferases. If the liver disease is primarily of
an obstructive nature (cholestatic), i.e. involving the
biliary drainage system, the alkaline phosphatase will
be the first and foremost enzyme elevation. If, on the
other hand, the disease is primarily of the liver cells
(hepatocytes), the aminotransferases will rise prominently. Thus, these enzymes are very useful in
distinguishing the type of liver disease–cholestatic or
hepatocellular.
Growing bones need alkaline phosphatase. Any
condition of bone growth will cause alkaline phosphatase levels to rise. The condition may be normal, such
as a childhood growth spurt or the healing of a broken
bone; or the condition may be a disease, such as bone
cancer, Paget’s disease, or rickets.
During pregnancy, alkaline phosphatase is made
by the placenta and leaks into the mother’s bloodstream. This is normal. Some tumors, however, start
production of the same kind of alkaline phosphatase
produced by the placenta. These tumors are called
germ cell tumors and include testicular cancer and
certain brain tumors.
Alkaline phosphatase from the intestine is
increased in a person with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis.
Description
Alkaline phosphatase is measured by combining
the person’s serum with specific substances with which
alkaline phosphatase is known to react. The end
product of this reaction is measured; and from that
measurement, the amount of alkaline phosphatase in
the person’s serum is determined.
Each tissue–liver, bone, placenta, and intestine–
produces a slightly different alkaline phosphatase.
These variations are called isoenzymes. In the laboratory, alkaline phosphatase is measured as the total
amount or the amount of each of the the four isoenzymes. The isoenzymes react differently to heat, certain chemicals, and other processes in the laboratory.
Methods to measure them separately are based on
these differences.
The test is covered by insurance when medically
necessary. Results are usually available the next day.
Preparation
To collect the 5-10 ml blood needed for this test, a
healthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s
upper arm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region,
and inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum action
draws the blood through the needle into an attached
tube. Collection of the sample takes only a few minutes.
A person being tested for alkaline phosphatase
should not have anything to eat or drink, except
water, for eight to ten hours before the test. Some
people release alkaline phosphatase from the intestine
into the bloodstream after eating. This will temporarily increase the result of the test.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to
the puncture site until the bleeding stops will reduce
bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve
discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results vary by age and by sex. They also
vary based on the laboratory and the method used.
Abnormal results
Bone and liver disease increase alkaline phosphatase more than any other disease, up to five times the
normal level. Irritable bowel disease, germ cell tumors,
and infections involving the liver, such as viral hepatitis and infectious mononucleosis, increase the enzyme
also, but to a lesser degree. Healing bones, pregnancy,
and normal growth in children also increase levels.
