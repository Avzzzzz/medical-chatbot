Definition
 Bonemarrowaspiration, also calledbone marrow
 sampling, is the removal by suction of fluid from the
 soft, spongy material that lines the inside of most
 bones. Bone marrow biopsy, or needle biopsy, is the
 removal of a small piece of bone marrow.
 Purpose
 Bone marrow aspiration is used to:
 pinpoint the cause of abnormal blood test results
 confirm a diagnosis or check the status of severe
 anemia (abnormally low numbers of red blood cells
 in the bloodstream) of unknown cause, or other
 irregularities in the way blood cells are produced or
 become mature.
 evaluate abnormalities in the blood’s ability to store
 iron.
 diagnose infection 
 Bone marrow biopsy is used to:
 obtain intact bone marrow for laboratory analysis
 diagnose and stage some types of cancer or anemia
 and other blood disorders
 identify the source of an unexplained fever
 diagnose fibrosis of bone marrow or myeloma (a
 tumor composed of cells normally found in the
 bone marrow)when bone marrow aspiration has
 failed to provide an appropriate specimen
 Bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy
 are also used to gauge the effectiveness of chemo the
rapy and other medical treatments.These procedures
 are often used together to ensure the availability of the
 best possible bone marrow specimen.
 Precautions
 Allergies or previous adverse reactions to medica
tions should be discussed with the doctor.Any current
 medications, including herbal or nutritional supple
ments,should be evaluated for the potential to interfere
 with proper coagulation(clotformation).These would
 include coumadin, aspirin, and other agents used as  blood thinners. Caution should be used when the
 herbs gingko,ginger,garlic,br ginseng have been uti
lized as supplements,due to a risk of bleeding. Pregnancy, lactation (production and secretion of
 milk), and preexisting platelet or bleeding disorders
 should be evaluated before either procedure is
 undertaken.
 Description
 Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be
 performed by a physician or nurse clinician. Each
 procedure takes about 20 to 30 minutes and is usually
 performed onanoutpatient basis, but can be done in a
 hospital if necessary.
 The skin covering the biopsy site is cleansed with
 an antiseptic, and the patient may be given a mild
 sedative. A local anesthetic is administered. The
 hematologist or nurse clinician performing the pro
cedure will not begin until the anesthetic has numbed
 theareafromwhichthespecimenistobeextracted.
 In both adults and children, aspiration and biopsy
 are most commonly performed on the rear bone of
 the hip (posterior iliac crest). In adults, sampling
 from the sternum (breastbone) is sometimes done.
 The latter location is technically easier, but is
 somewhat more painful for the patient and presents
 the risk of heart injury. On rare occasions, a long
 bone of the leg (tibia) may be used as a sample site
 for an infant.
 In a bone marrow aspiration, a special needle is
 inserted beneath the skin and rotated until it pene
trates the cortex, or outer covering of the bone. At
 least half a teaspoon of marrow is withdrawn from
 the bone by a syringe attached to the needle. The
 patient may experience discomfort when the needle
 is inserted or when the marrow is aspirated. If more
 marrow is needed, the needle is repositioned slightly,
 a new syringe is attached, and a second sample is
 taken. The samples are transferred from the syringes
 to slides and vials, then sent to a laboratory for
 analysis.
 Bone marrow biopsy may be performed immedi
ately before or after bone marrow aspiration. The
 procedure utilizes a special large-bore needle that is
 used to drill out a core of marrow. In bone marrow
 biopsy, the needle is inserted, rotated from side to side,
 withdrawn, and reinserted at a different angle. This
 procedure is repeated if needed until a small core,
 about 0.4 inches (1 cm) long, is separated from the
 bone marrow. The needle is again removed, and a
 piece of fine wire threaded through its tip transfers
 the specimen onto sterile gauze. The patient may feel
 discomfort or pressure when the needle is inserted and
 experience a brief, pulling sensation when the marrow
 is withdrawn. Unlike aspiration specimens, which are
 smeared, these samples contain structurally intact
 bone marrow. Microscopic examination can show
 what material its cells contain and how they are alike
 or different from one another. The bone may either be
 embedded intact in paraffin (a type of wax), or be
 decalcified (a process which takes place overnight)
 for a different type of staining and examination.
 Each type of preparation has certain advantages.
 Preparation
 Acurrent history and physical are obtained from
 the patient, along with proper consent. The patient is
 generally placed in a prone position (lying face down)
 for preparation, and local anesthetic, with or without
 sedation, is administered.
 Aftercare
 After the needle is removed, the biopsy site will be
 covered with a clean, dry bandage. Pressure is applied
 to control bleeding. The patient’s pulse, breathing,
 blood pressure, and temperature are monitored until
 they return to normal, and the patient may be
 instructed to remain in a supine position (lying face
 up) for half an hour before getting dressed.
 The patient should be able to leave the clinic and
 resume normal activities immediately. Patients who
 have received a sedative often feel sleepy for the rest
 of the day; driving, cooking, and other activities that
 require clear thinking and quick reactions should
 therefore be avoided.
 The biopsy site should be kept covered and dry
 for several hours. Walking or taking prescribed pain
 medications usually ease any discomfort felt at the
 biopsy site, and ice can be used to reduce swelling.
 Adoctor should be notified if the patient:

 experiences persistent bleeding or notices more than
 a few drops of blood on the wound dressing.
 has a temperature above 101F (38.3C). Inflam
mation and pus at the biopsy site and other signs
 of infection should also be reported to a doctor with
out delay.
 Risks
 Bleeding and discomfort often occur at the biopsy
 site. Infection and hematoma may also develop. In
 rare instances, the heart or a major blood vessel is
 pierced when marrow is extracted from the sternum  during bone marrow biopsy. This can lead to severe
 hemorrhage.

 Abnormal results
 Culture of bone marrow aspirate may yield infor
mation about an infectious agent. Microscopic exam
ination of bone marrow can reveal granulomas,
 myelofibrosis, lymphomas, leukemias, or other cancers.
 Analyzing specimens can help doctors diagnose iron
 deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, and folate defi
ciency, as well as anemia.
 Obesity can affect the ease with which a bone
 marrow biopsy can be done, and the results of either
 procedure can be affected if the patient has had
 radiation therapy at the biopsy site.
