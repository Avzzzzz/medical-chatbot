Definition
A delayed hypersensitivity test (DHT) is an
immune function test measuring the presence of activated T cells that recognize a certain substance.
Purpose
The immune system protects against infection by
viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. After initial
exposure to a foreign substance, or antigen, the
immune system creates both antibodies and sensitized
T cells. Both these immune agents respond when the
body is reexposed to the antigen. Antibodies, which
are circulating proteins, respond within minutes, to
give what, is termed an immediate hypersensitivity
reaction. T cells responses occur over several days,
and are thus called delayed hypersensitivity reactions.
The cascade of events initiated by the T cells leads to
hardening (induration) and redness (erythema) at the
injection site.
A DHT is performed for one of three reasons:
 To test for exposure to specific diseases, such as
tuberculosis (TB). Tuberculosis testing is done by
injecting into the skin a small volume of TB antigen,
which contains no organisms (live or dead) but can
still provoke an immune response.
 To test for allergic sensitivity to potential skin irritants, such as poison ivy. Skin allergy testing is
usually done by placing a series of adhesive patches
on the skin containing potential allergens, or allergycausing substances.
 To assess the vitality of the T cell response as part of
the evaluation of immune system health in infection,
cancer, immune disorders, pre-transplantation
screening, aging, and malnutrition. DHT can help
predict survival in immunocompromised patients,
and evaluate the success of restorative therapy.
Antigens used for these tests must be ones the patient
has been exposed to before, and, therefore, include
inactivated antigens from common infectious agents
to which the patient might have been exposed, such
as mumps, Candida albicans, tetanus toxoid, and
trichophyton (a skin fungus).
Precautions
No special precautions are necessary for most
patients. Those with known hypersensitivity to certain
skin irritants should alert the clinician performing the
test. Some commercial preparations of fungal antigens
contain mercury, a source of irritation to some
patients.
Description
The most accurate TB test is the Mantoux test, in
which a small amount of TB antigen is injected into the
skin. The area is examined 48–72 hours after the
injection.
In the patch test, 20–30 adhesive patches are
usually placed on the upper back. The patches are
kept in place and the area is kept dry for 48 hours.
The patches are then removed, and the skin is
examined 24 hours afterward, and possibly again a
day or more following that. Patch testing is usually
performed following a patient complaint of skin irritation from an unknown substance. Testing may suggest
several candidates; identifying the right one requires
careful review of the patient’s possible exposure.
The test of overall T cell responsiveness is performed with several injections. Each area injected is
circled and marked. Results are read 48 hours after the
injection.
Preparation
No special preparation is necessary.
Aftercare
Patches should be kept dry. Injection sites may be
washed, but excessive rubbing should be avoided.
Patches and injection sites may become reddened or
irritated. If a patch causes severe itching or discomfort, the patient should remove it immediately.
Risks
DHT is quite safe for virtually all people. There is
no risk of infection from the agents injected, since
they are purified antigens, not whole organisms. Life
threatening, hypersensitive reactions (anaphylaxis)
are a very small risk; patients should notify the
administering physician immediately if signs of
wheezing, swelling, or diffuse redness of the skin
develops.
Normal results
Absence of exposure to TB is indicated by absent
or very little skin reaction; redness or hardness smaller
than 5 mm (about 0.25 in) is considered normal for a
person not exposed or infected with TB.
Patch test sites should be normal or only
slightly red.
T cell responsiveness tests should be positive; that
is, the injected areas should be reddened and hard.
Two affected areas of 2 mm or more is considered a
positive result.
Abnormal results
TB exposure is indicated by a reaction of 10 mm
or more. The degree of redness is not important. A
5–10 mm area could indicate exposure if there is an
underlying risk to TB.
Patch test areas that become reddened and irritated indicate reaction to the substance in the patch.
Absence of any reaction to injected areas indicates
lack of T cell responsiveness, a condition called
anergy. T cell anergy is seen in immune deficiency
diseases including AIDS, some cases of infectious diseases, malignancies, immunosuppressive therapy
(including corticosteroid treatment), some autoimmune diseases, malnutrition, major surgery, and
some viral immunizations.
