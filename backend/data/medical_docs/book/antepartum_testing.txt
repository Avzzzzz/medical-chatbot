Definition
Antepartum testing consists of a variety of tests
performed late in pregnancy to verify fetal well-being,
as judged by the baby’s heart rate and other characteristics. Antepartum tests include the nonstress test
(NST), biophysical profile, and contraction stress
test (CST).
Purpose
Antepartum testing is performed after 32 weeks of
pregnancy so that the couple and the doctor can be
warned of any problems that may necessitate further
testing or immediate delivery. The results reflect the
adequacy of blood flow (and oxygen delivery) to the
fetus from the placenta.
Antepartum tests are usually done in pregnancies
at high risk for fetal complications. Various reasons
include:

any chronic illness in the mother, such as high blood
pressure or diabetes

problems with previous pregnancies, such as
stillbirth

fetal complications, such as intrauterine growth retardation (a slowing of growth of the fetus) or birth
defects

problems in the current pregnancy, including preeclampsia (serious pregnancy-induced high blood
pressure), gestational (pregnancy-related) diabetes,
premature rupture of the membranes, excessive
amniotic fluid (the liquid that surrounds the fetus),
vaginal bleeding, or placenta previa (a condition in
which the placenta is positioned over the cervix
instead of near the top of the uterus)

twins or other multiple fetuses
One of the most common indications for antepartum testing is post-term pregnancy. A pregnancy
should not be allowed to continue past 42 weeks.
(The usual pregnancy is 40 weeks in duration).
Babies should be monitored with antepartum testing
starting at 41 weeks. After 41 weeks, there is an
increasing risk that the placenta cannot meet the growing baby’s needs for oxygen and nutrition. This may be
reflected in decreased movements of the baby,
decreased amniotic fluid, and changes in the heart
rate pattern of the baby.
Description
Technology
The NST and CST use a technique called electronic fetal monitoring to evaluate the heartbeat of the
fetus. The biophysical profile is an ultrasound
examination.
NST
The NST is usually the first antepartum test used to
verify fetal well-being. It is based on the principle that
when the fetus moves, its heartbeat normally speeds up.
The NST assesses fetal health through monitoring
accelerations of the heart rate in response to the
baby’s own movements, i.e., in the absence of stress.
The mother lays down or sits, and an electronic
fetal monitor is placed on her abdomen to monitor the
fetal heart rate. The doctor records the baby’s heartbeat on a graph or ‘‘tracing’’ to determine whether it
demonstrates correct reactivity, or acceleration of the
heart rate. To record fetal movements on the tracing,
the mother presses a button every time she feels the
baby move. If the baby is inactive, the mother may be
asked to rub her abdomen to ‘‘awaken’’ it. Sometimes
an instrument is used to produce a loud noise to arouse
the fetus (vibroacoustic stimulation). The test usually
takes between 20–45 minutes.
A baby who is receiving enough oxygen should
move at least twice in a 20 minute period. The baby’s
heart rate should increase at least 20 beats per minute
for at least 20 seconds during these movements. The
NST is the simplest and cheapest antepartum test.
Biophysical profile
The biophysical profile is an ultrasound exam that
can add additional information to the NST. During
the biophysical profile, the examiner checks for various characteristics of the baby to evaluate its overall
health. These include: fetal movement, fetal tone,
breathing movements, and the amniotic fluid volume.
Amniotic fluid volume is important because a
decreased amount raises the possibility that the baby
may be under stress. The five components of the test
(NST is also included) are each given a score of 2 for
normal (or present), 1 if decreased, and 0 for abnormal. The highest possible score is 10. The ‘‘modified’’
biophysical profile is another option; this includes
only the NST and amniotic fluid volume.
CST
The CST is like the NST, except that the fetus is
evaluated in response to contractions of the mother’s
uterus. Because it is a more complicated test, it is often
used after an abnormal NST to confirm the results.
Uterine contractions produce ‘‘stress’’ in the fetus
because they temporarily stop the flow of blood and
oxygen. The CST is used to confirm that the fetus does
not respond to this stress by a decrease in the heart rate.
The CST is performed with the same equipment as
the NST. Maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate
are recorded along with the onset, relative intensity,
and duration of any spontaneous contractions. For an
accurate test, the contractions should be of sufficient
duration and frequency. If uterine activity does not
occur naturally, a drug called oxytocin may be given to
the mother intravenously (hence the test’s alternate
name, the oxytocin challenge test) to provoke
contractions. Another option is self-stimulation of
the mother’s nipples, because this releases natural
oxytocin. The fetal heart rate is observed until, ideally,
three moderate contractions occur within 10 minutes.
Preparation
The mother should eat just before the antepartum
tests to help stimulate fetal activity.
Risks
There are no appreciable risks from the NST or
the biophysical profile. Ultrasound used for the biophysical profile is painless and safe because it uses no
harmful radiation, and no evidence has been found
that sound waves cause any adverse effects on the
mother or fetus.
The frequency of antepartum testing depends on
the reason for its use. All of the tests occasionally give
incorrect results, which may prompt an unnecessary
early delivery or cesarean. Repeat testing is important
to double-check any abnormal findings.
Normal results
In general, ‘‘negative’’ or normal results on antepartum testing provide reassurance that the baby is
healthy and should remain so for perhaps a week, with
no need for immediate delivery. Unfortunately, the
tests cannot guarantee that there are no problems,
because falsely normal results can occur, though this
is unusual. Even if all test results are normal, it is
important to realize that this does not guarantee a
‘‘perfect’’ baby.
The NST is normal (‘‘reactive’’) if two or more
distinct fetal movements occur in association with
appropriate accelerations of the fetal heart rate within
20 minutes. A biophysical profile score of 8-10 is considered reassuring. The CST is normal if the fetus
shows no decelerations in heart rate in response to
three uterine contractions within 10 minutes.
Abnormal results
A ‘‘positive’’ result suggests that the baby is not
receiving enough oxygen for some reason. However, it
is quite possible that the test result was falsely abnormal. To confirm or monitor a suspected disorder,
follow-up testing with the same or an alternate test
will probably be performed at least weekly.
The NST is abnormal (‘‘nonreactive’’) if the fetal
heart rate fails to speed up by at least 20 beats per
minute at least two times during a 20-minute period.
Abnormal decreases in the heart rate (decelerations)
are also a cause for concern.
A biophysical profile score of 6 is considered a
cause for concern and should be followed by further
testing. Scores of 4 or less may require immediate
delivery of the fetus.
Abnormal results on the CST include late decelerations, or abnormal slowing of the fetal heart rate
after the uterine contractions. This can suggest that
the baby is not receiving enough oxygen and may have
difficulty withstanding the stress of labor and vaginal
delivery. Cesarean section might be necessary so the
baby can be spared the stress of labor. With either
NST or CST, a severe deceleration (a period of very
slow heartbeat) can also suggest fetal distress.
The ultimate outcome will depend on the woman’s
individual situation. In some cases, delivery can be postponed while medication is given to the mother (e.g., for
high blood pressure) or the fetus (e.g., to speed up lung
maturity before delivery).Depending upon the readiness
of the mother’s cervix, the doctor may decide to induce
labor. The extra-large fetus of a diabetic woman may
require cesarean delivery; severe preeclampsia also may
necessitate induction of labor or cesarean section. The
doctor will determine the most prudent course of action.
