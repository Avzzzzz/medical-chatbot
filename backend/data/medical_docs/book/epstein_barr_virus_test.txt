Definition
The Epstein-Barr virus test is a blood test, or
group of tests, to determine the presence or absence
of antibodies in the blood stream directed against
proteins of the Epstein-Barr virus, the cause of
infectious mononucleosis.
Purpose
The test is primarily used to detect whether first
time infection (called primary infection) with the
Epstein-Barr virus is currently occurring, or has
occurred within a short period of time. The pattern
of the antibodies detected can, however, tell if the
person has never been infected with the Epstein-Barr
virus, or if the infection occurred in the more distant
past. These tests are mostly utilized in the diagnosis of
Epstein-Barr virus-associated infectious mononucleosis when the more common diagnostic test, the heterophile antibody, is negative, or in situations where the
infection is manifesting unusual symptoms. Therefore,
the tests are often not needed in a situation where a
doctor believes that a person has mononucleosis and
the heterophile test (also called the monospot test) is
positive.
In addition, Epstein-Barr virus testing is usually
not needed in the evaluation of a patient who has
long-lasting fatigue, and may have the chronic fatigue
syndrome. Initially, it was thought that discovering a
particular pattern of antibodies to this virus was
helpful in the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome,
but this no longer appears to be the case.
Precautions
As in any blood test, standard precautions should
be performed to prevent infection at the site where the
blood is obtained, and to prevent excess bleeding.
Normally, the site is cleaned with an antiseptic
liquid prior to the blood being obtained; a sterile
non-reusable needle and syringe are used; and, once
the needle is removed, pressure is placed at the site
until bleeding has stopped.
Description
These tests are more often performed in a consulting laboratory than at a physician’s office or in a
hospital laboratory. Like most antibody tests, they
are performed on serum, the liquid part of the blood
obtained after the whole blood is allowed to clot in
a tube. Antibodies can be detected against several
components of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). These
components are the EBV early antigen (EA), the viral
capsid antigen (VCA), and the nuclear antigen
(EBNA). These several antigens are different proteins
that are produced in the process (stages) of the virus’
growth.At the time of infection with Epstein-Barr virus,
antibodies to EA are found and usually last for four to
six months only. This antibody, however, persists
substantially longer in about 10% of persons who
have had EBV infection in the more remote past. The
absence of antibody to EA when other EBV antibodies
are present strongly suggests that first time infection
with EBV occurred in the past.
Antibody to VCA is found both early and late in
EBV infection. At the time of infection, antibody of
both the IgM and IgG types are detectable. After four
to six months, usually, only the IgG antibody against
VCA can be found.
Unlike antibodies to EA and VCA, antibody to
EBNA does not usually develop until recovery from
first time infection of this virus. Therefore, finding
detectable amounts of antibody to EBNA during an
illness which might be caused by EBV makes the
causal relationship very unlikely.
Preparation
The skin area from which the blood sample will be
obtained is wiped with an antiseptic such as alcohol or
iodine.
Aftercare
The aftercare is similar to that for any blood test.
Usually, pressure is applied to the area for several
moments until bleeding stops. If the results are difficult
to interpret, it may be necessary to re-test later, after
waiting one to three weeks. The change in the amounts
of antibody detected between the two tests can be particularly useful, at times, in helping to make a diagnosis.
Risks
There are no risks over and above those of having
blood drawn for any other purpose. These tests are
more expensive than many other blood tests but are
usually covered by medical insurance.
Normal results
The pattern of the three antibodies can be used to
determine whether the person has not had infection
with EBV to this point (is susceptible to infection); is
currently, or recently, infected with EBV for the
first time; or has had first time infection with EBV
sometime in the past (more than six months ago).
If one defines ‘‘normal’’ results as either not
having EBV in the past, and call that category one;
or having had it in the past, and call that category
two. Most young children below the age of five will
fall into category one, while most adults over the age
of 20 years will fall into category two.
The results for susceptibility are:
 antibody to EA = negative
 antibody to VCA (either IgM or IgG) = negative
 antibody to EBNA = negative
The results for past infection are:
 antibody to EA = negative (90% of time)
 antibody to VCA IgM = negative
 Antibody to VCA IgG = positive
 Antibody to EBNA = Positive.
It is important to realize that the Epstein-Barr
virus, like all the human herpes viruses, does not
totally leave the body after the patient recovers from
illness. With EBV, the virus will intermittently recur in
the saliva of people without any symptoms. Such people will have a test pattern of previous infection. It is
this group of people who can transmit EBV to others
without themselves being ill.
Abnormal results
The results for current or recent infection are:
 antibody to EA = positive
 antibody to VCA IgM = positive
 antibody to VCA IgG = positive
 antibody to EBNA = negative.
Without the pattern of the three antibodies, it can
be difficult to be accurate in interpretation. The presence of antibody to VCA IgM is the best single test
for current or recent first time infection.
