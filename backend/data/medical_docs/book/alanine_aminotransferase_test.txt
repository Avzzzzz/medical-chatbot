Definition
The alanine aminotransferase test, also known as
ALT, is one of a group of tests known as liver function
tests (or LFTs) and is used to monitor damage to the
liver.
Purpose
ALT levels are used to detect liver abnormalities.
Since the alanine aminotransferase enzyme is also
found in muscle, tests indicating elevated AST levels
might also indicate muscle damage. However, other
tests, such as the levels of the MB fraction of creatine
kinase should indicate whether the abnormal test
levels are because of muscle or liver damage.
Description
The alanine aminotransferase test (ALT) can
reveal liver damage. It is probably the most specific
test for liver damage. However, the severity of the liver
damage is not necessarily shown by the ALT test, since
the amount of dead liver tissue does not correspond to
higher ALT levels. Also, patients with normal, or
declining, ALT levels may experience serious liver
damage without an increase in ALT.
Nevertheless, ALT is widely used, and useful,
because ALT levels are elevated in most patients with
liver disease. Although ALT levels do not necessarily
indicate the severity of the damage to the liver, they
may indicate how much of the liver has been damaged.
ALT levels, when compared to the levels of a similar
enzyme, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), may provide important clues to the nature of the liver disease.
For example, within a certain range of values, a ratio
of 2:1 or greater for AST: ALT might indicate that a
patient suffers from alcoholic liver disease. Other diagnostic data may be gleaned from ALT tests to indicate
abnormal results
Preparation
No special preparations are necessary for this test.
Aftercare
This test involves blood being drawn, probably
from a vein in the patientâ€™s elbow. The patient should
keep the wound from the needle puncture covered
(with a bandage) until the bleeding stops. Patients
should report any unusual symptoms to their
physician.
Normal results
Normal values vary from laboratory to laboratory, and should be available to your physician at the
time of the test. An informal survey of some laboratories indicates many laboratories find values from
approximately seven to 50 IU/L to be normal.
Abnormal results
Low levels of ALT (generally below 300 IU/L)
may indicate any kind of liver disease. Levels above
1,000 IU/L generally indicate extensive liver damage
from toxins or drugs, viral hepatitis, or a lack of oxygen (usually resulting from very low blood pressure or
a heart attack). A briefly elevated ALT above 1,000
IU/L that resolves in 24-48 hours may indicate a
blockage of the bile duct. More moderate levels of
ALT (300-1,000IU/L) may support a diagnosis of
acute or chronic hepatitis.
It is important to note that persons with normal
livers may have slightly elevated levels of ALT. This is
a normal finding.
