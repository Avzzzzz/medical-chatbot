Definition
AIDS tests, short for acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome tests, cover a number of different procedures used in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV
patients. These tests sometimes are called AIDS
serology tests. Serology is the branch of immunology
that deals with the contents and characteristics of
blood serum. Serum is the clear light yellow part
of blood that remains liquid when blood cells form
a clot. AIDS serology evaluates the presence of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in
blood serum and its effects on each patient’s immune
system.
Purpose
AIDS serology serves several different purposes.
Some AIDS tests are used to diagnose patients or
confirm a diagnosis; others are used to measure the
progression of the disease or the effectiveness of specific treatment regimens. Some AIDS tests also can be
used to screen blood donations for safe use in
transfusions.
In order to understand the different purposes
of the blood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful to understand how HIV infection affects human
blood and the immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that
enters the blood stream of a new host in the following
ways:

by sexual contact

by contact with infected body fluids (such as blood
and urine)

by transmission during pregnancy, or

through transfusion of infected blood products
A retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique
enzyme called reverse transcriptase that allows it to
replicate within new host cells. The virus binds to a
protein called CD4, which is found on the surface of
certain subtypes of white blood cells, including helper
T cells, macrophages, and monocytes. Once HIV
enters the cell, it can replicate and kill the cell in
ways that are still not completely understood. In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly, the AIDS
virus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4
cells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance called
interleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells
(T cells and B cells) in the human immune system
to respond to infections. Without the IL-2, T cells do
not reproduce as they normally would in response to the
HIV virus, and B cells are not stimulated to respond
to the infection.
Precautions
In some states such as New York, a signed consent
form is needed in order to administer an AIDS test. As
with all blood tests, healthcare professionals should
always wear latex gloves and avoid being pricked by
the needle used in drawing blood for the tests. It may
be difficult to get blood from a habitual intravenous
drug user due to collapsed veins.
Description
Diagnostic tests
Diagnostic blood tests for AIDS usually are given
to persons in high-risk populations who may have
been exposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms
of AIDS. Most persons infected with HIV will develop
a detectable level of antibody within three months of
infection. The condition of testing positive for HIV
antibody in the blood is called seroconversion, and
persons who have become HIV-positive are called
seroconverters.
It is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolating the virus itself from a blood sample or by demonstrating the presence of HIV antigen in the blood.
Viral culture, however, is expensive, not widely available, and slow—it takes 28 days to complete the viral
culture test. More common are blood tests that work
by detecting the presence of antibodies to the HIV
virus. These tests are inexpensive, widely available,
and accurate in detecting 99.9% of AIDS infections
when used in combination to screen patients and
confirm diagnoses.
ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA).
This type of blood test is used to screen blood for
transfusions as well as diagnose patients. An ELISA
test for HIV works by attaching HIV antigens to a
plastic well or beads. A sample of the patient’s blood
serum is added, and excess proteins are removed.
A second antibody coupled to an enzyme is added,
followed by addition of a substance that will cause
the enzyme to react by forming a color. An instrument called a spectrophotometer can measure the
color. The name of the test is derived from the use
of the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the second
antibody.
The latest generation of ELISA tests are 99.5%
sensitive to HIV. Occasionally, the ELISA test will be
positive for a patient without symptoms of AIDS from
a low-risk group. Because this result is likely to be a
false-positive, the ELISA must be repeated on the same
sample of the patient’s blood. If the second ELISA is
positive, the result should be confirmed by the
Western blot test.
WESTERN BLOT (IMMUNOBLOT). The Western blot
or immunoblot test is used as a reference procedure to
confirm the diagnosis of AIDS. In Western blot testing, HIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis (large
protein molecules are suspended in a gel and separated
from one another by running an electric current
through the gel). The HIV antigens are attached by
blotting to a nylon or nitrocellulose filter. The
patient’s serum is reacted against the filter, followed
by treatment with developing chemicals that allow
HIV antibody to show up as a colored patch or blot.
A commercially produced Western blot test for HIV-1
is now available. It consists of a prefabricated
strip that is incubated with a sample of the patient’s
blood serum and the developing chemicals. About
nine different HIV-1 proteins can be detected in
the blots.
When used in combination with ELISA testing,
Western blot testing is 99.9% specific. It can, however,
yield false negatives in patients with very early HIV
infection and in those infected by HIV-2. In some
patients the Western blot yields indeterminate results.
IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY (IFA). This method
is sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead of
Western blotting. An IFA test detects the presence of
HIV antibody in a sample of the patient’s serum by
mixing HIV antigen with a fluorescent chemical, adding the blood sample, and observing the reaction
under a microscope with ultraviolet light.
POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR). This test is
used to evaluate the very small number of AIDS
patients with false-negative ELISA and Western blot
tests. These patients are sometimes called antibodynegative asymptomatic (without symptoms) carriers,
because they do not have any symptoms of AIDS and
there is no detectable quantity of antibody in the blood
serum. Antibody-negative asymptomatic carriers may
be responsible for the very low ongoing risk of HIV
infection transmitted by blood transfusions. It is estimated that the risk is between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in
100,000 units of transfused blood.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can
measure the presence of viral nucleic acids in the
patient’s blood even when there is no detectable antibody to HIV. This test works by amplifying the presence of HIV nucleic acids in a blood sample.
Numerous copies of a gene are made by separating
the two strands of DNA containing the gene segment,
marking its location, using DNA polymerase to make
a copy, and then continuously replicating the copies. It
is questionable whether PCR will replace Western
blotting as the method of confirming AIDS diagnoses.
Although PCR can detect the low number of persons
(1%) with HIV infections that have not yet generated
an antibody response to the virus, the overwhelming
majority of infected persons will be detected by ELISA
screening within one to three months of infection.
In addition, PCR testing is based on present knowledge of the genetic sequences in HIV. Since the virus
is continually generating new variants, PCR testing
could yield a false negative in patients with these
new variants. In 2004, researchers reported on a new
test that was more sensitive to HIV, detecting the
infection in as little as 12 days after infection.
However, the manufacturer was still seeking FDA
approval for the test, which would cost about the
same as PCR testing
In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved an HIV home testing kit. The kit
contained multiple components, including material
for specimen collection, a mailing envelope to send
the specimen to a laboratory for analysis, and provides
pre- and post-test counseling. It uses a finger prick
process for blood collection. Other tests have been in
development that would allow patients to monitor
their own therapy in the home without sending out
for results.
Prognostic tests
Blood tests to evaluate patients already diagnosed
with HIV infection are as important as the diagnostic
tests. Because AIDS has a long latency period, some
persons may be infected with the virus for 10 years or
longer before they develop symptoms of AIDS. These
patients are sometimes called antibody-positive
asymptomatic carriers. Prognostic tests also help
drug researchers evaluate the usefulness of new medications in treating AIDS.
BLOOD CELL COUNTS. Doctors can measure the
number or proportion of certain types of cells in an
AIDS patient’s blood to see whether and how rapidly
the disease is progressing, or whether certain treatments are helping the patient. These cell count tests
include:

Complete blood count (CBC). A CBC is a routine
analysis performed on a sample of blood taken
from the patient’s vein with a needle and vacuum
tube. The measurements taken in a CBC include a
white blood cell count (WBC), a red blood cell count
(RBC), the red cell distribution width, the hematocrit
(ratio of the volume of the red blood cells to the
blood volume), and the amount of hemoglobin (the
blood protein that carries oxygen). Although CBCs
are used on more than just AIDS patients, they can
help the doctor determine if an AIDS patient has an
advanced form of the disease. Specific AIDS-related
signs in a CBC include a low hematocrit, a sharp
decrease in the number of blood platelets, and a
low level of a certain type of white blood cell called
neutrophils.

Absolute CD4+ lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a
type of white blood cell that is important in the
formation of an immune response. Because HIV
targets CD4+ lymphocytes, their number in the
patient’s blood can be used to track the course of
the infection. This blood cell count is considered the
most accurate indicator for the presence of an opportunistic infection in an AIDS patient. The absolute
CD4+ lymphocyte count is obtained by multiplying
the patient’s white blood cell count (WBC) by the
percentage of lymphocytes among the white blood
cells, and multiplying the result by the percentage
of lymphocytes bearing the CD4+ marker. An absolute count below 200-300 CD+4 lymphocytes
in 1 cubic millimeter (mm3
) of blood indicates that
the patient is vulnerable to some opportunistic
infections.

CD4+ lymphocyte percentage. Some doctors think
that this is a more accurate test than the absolute
count because the percentage does not depend on a
manual calculation of the number of types of different white blood cells. A white blood cell count that is
broken down into categories in this way is called a
WBC differential.
It is important for doctors treating AIDS patients
to measure the lymphocyte count on a regular basis.
Experts consulted by the United States Public Health
Service recommend the following frequency of serum
testing based on the patient’s CD4+ level:

CD4+ count more than 600 cells/mm3
: Every six
months.

CD4+ count between 200-600 cells/mm3
: Every
three months.

CD4+ count less than 200 cells/mm3
: Every three
months.
When the CD4+ count falls below 200 cells/mm3
,
the doctor will put the patient on a medication regimen to protect him or her against opportunistic
infections.
HIV VIRAL LOAD TESTS. Another type of blood test
for monitoring AIDS patients is the viral load test. It
supplements the CD4+ count, which can tell the doctor the extent of the patient’s loss of immune function,
but not the speed of HIV replication in the body. The
viral load test is based on PCR techniques and can
measure the number of copies of HIV nucleic acids.
Successive test results for a given patient’s viral load
are calculated on a base 10 logarithmic scale.
ORAL HIV TESTS. Scientists have developed oral
HIV tests that can be conducted with saliva samples.
One of the unintented effects of these tests is the
misperception that HIV can be transmitted through
saliva. Still, they present an excellent alternative to
blood sample testing.
RAPID HIV TESTS. Researchers constantly work on
more rapid tests for HIV that can be done in physician
offices or by less skilled people and more convenient
locations in developing countries. A finger-stick test
that can be read quickly from a whole blood sample
had shown promising results in the fall of 2003.
Another test, called the VScan test kit, requires no
refrigeration or electricity and can safely be stored at
room temperature. Even if the positive results must be
confirmed by ELISA or Western blotting, an accurate
initial rapid test can help screen populations for HIV
antibodies.
In 2004, a new three-minute test for HIV was
lunched in the United States under FDA approval.
The hope of this test is that health care providers
such as family practice physician offices can quickly
test a patient in the office and provide results while the
patient waits, rather than sending results to a lab.
BETA2-MICROGLOBULIN (BETA2M). Beta-microglobulin is a protein found on the surface of all human
cells with a nucleus. It is released into the blood when a
cell dies. Although rising blood levels of  2M are found
in patients with cancer and other serious diseases, a
rising  2M blood level can be used to measure the
progression of AIDS.
P24 ANTIGEN CAPTURE ASSAY. Found in the viral
core of HIV, p24 is a protein that can be measured by
the ELISA technique. Doctors can use p24 assays to
measure the antiviral activity of the patient’s medications. In addition, the p24 assay is sometimes useful
in detecting HIV infection before seroconversion.
However, p24 is consistently present in only 25% of
persons infected with HIV.
GENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TEST. Genotypic
testing can help determine whether specific gene
mutations, common in people with HIV, are causing
drug resistance and drug failure. The test looks for
specific genetic mutations within the virus that are
known to cause resistance to certain drugs used in
HIV treatment. For example the drug 3TC, also
known as lamivudine (Epivir), is not effective against
strains of HIV that have a mutation at a particular
position on the reverse transcriptase protein—amino
acid 184—known as M184V (M!V, methionine to
valine). So if the genotypic resistance test shows a
mutation at position M184V, it is likely the person
is resistant to 3TC and not likely to respond to 3TC
treatment. Genotypic tests are only effective if the
person is already taking antiviral medication and if
the viral load is greater than 1,000 copies per milliliter
(mL) of blood. The cost of the test, usually between
$300 and $500, is usually now covered by many insurance plans.
PHENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TESTING.
Phenotypic testing directly measures the sensitivity of
a patient’s HIV to particular drugs and drug combinations. To do this, it measures the concentration of a
drug required to inhibit viral replication in the test
tube. This is the same method used by researchers to
determine whether a drug might be effective against
HIV before using it in human clinical trials.
Phenotypic testing is a more direct measurement of
resistance than genotypic testing. Also, unlike genotypic testing, phenotypic testing does not require a high
viral load but it is recommended that persons already
be taking antiretroviral drugs. The cost is between $700
and $900 and is now covered by many insurance plans.
AIDS serology in children
Children born to HIV-infected mothers may
acquire the infection through the mother’s placenta
or during the birth process. Public health experts
recommend the testing and monitoring of all children
born to mothers with HIV. Diagnostic testing in children older than 18 months is similar to adult testing,
with ELISA screening confirmed by Western blot.
Younger infants can be diagnosed by direct culture
of the HIV virus, PCR testing, and p24 antigen testing.
These techniques allow a pediatrician to identify 50%
of infected children at or near birth, and 95% of cases
in infants three to six months of age.
Preparation
Preparation and aftercare are important parts of
AIDS diagnostic testing. Doctors are now advised to
take the patient’s emotional, social, economic, and
other circumstances into account and to provide counseling before and after testing. Patients are generally
better able to cope with the results if the doctor has
spent some time with them before the blood test
explaining the basic facts about HIV infection and
testing. Many doctors now offer this type of informational counseling before performing the tests.
Aftercare
If the test results indicate that the patient is HIVpositive, he or she will need counseling, information,
referral for treatment, and support. Doctors can either
counsel the patient themselves or invite an experienced
HIV counselor to discuss the results of the blood tests
with the patient. They also will assess the patient’s
emotional and psychological status, including the possibility of violent behavior and the availability of a
support network.
Risks
The risks of AIDS testing are primarily related to
disclosure of the patient’s HIV status rather than to
any physical risks connected with blood testing. Some
patients are better prepared to cope with a positive
diagnosis than others, depending on their age, sex,
health, resources, belief system, and similar factors.
Normal results
Normal results for ELISA, Western blot, IFA,
and PCR testing are negative for HIV antibody.
Normal results for blood cell counts:

WBC differential: Total lymphocytes 24-44% of the
white blood cells.

Hematocrit: 40-54% in men; 37-47% in women.

T cell lymphocytes: 644-2200/mm3
, 60-88% of all
lymphocytes.

B cell lymphocytes: 82-392/mm3
, 3-20% of all
lymphocytes.

CD4+ lymphocytes: 500-1200/mm3
, 34-67% of all
lymphocytes.
Abnormal results
The following results in AIDS tests indicate progression of the disease:

Percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes: less than 20% of
all lymphocytes.

CD4+ lymphocyte count: less than 200 cells/mm3
.

Viral load test: Levels more than 5000 copies/mL.


:-2-microglobulin: Levels more than 3.5 mg/dL.

P24 antigen: Measurable amounts in blood serum.
