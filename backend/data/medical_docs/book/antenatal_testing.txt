Definition
Antenatal testing includes any diagnostic procedures performed before the birth of a baby.
Purpose
These tests and exams are essential for protecting
the health of a pregnant woman and her developing
child.
Precautions
Some tests, such as amniocentisis, carry a small
risk of a miscarriage or other complications that could
harm the mother or baby.
Description
Women who become pregnant undergo a wide
variety of tests throughout the nine months before
delivery. In the early stages, physicians order blood
tests to screen for possible disorders or infections, such
as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which can
pass from the mother to the fetus. Later, the focus
shifts to checking on fetal well-being with a variety of
technological tools such as ultrasound scans.
Descriptions of the most common tests and procedures used during pregnancy are listed below.
When a woman first learns she is pregnant, her
physician will run a series of routine urine and blood
tests to determine her blood type, check for anemia
and gestational diabetes, make sure she is immune to
rubella (German measles) and check for infectious
diseases like HIV, hepatitis, chlamydia or syphilis.
Physicians also usually do pelvic exam to screen for
cervical cancer and check the patient’s blood pressure.
As the pregnancy progresses, more tests will follow.
Ultrasound
Ultrasound is a device that records sound waves
as they bounce off the developing fetus to create an
image, which is projected onto a large computer
screen. Physicians order an ultrasound scan to listen
for a fetal heartbeat, determine a woman’s precise due
date and check for twins, among other uses. An ultrasound scan also is known as a sonogram. The procedure takes a few minutes, is painless and usually is
covered by health insurance.
The ultrasound technician will ask the pregnant
woman to remove her clothes and change into a gown.
The technician may rub some gel on the woman’s stomach, which helps the hand-held device pick up sound
waves better. In certain cases, the technician may insert
a plastic probe into the woman’s vaginal canal to get a
clearer picture of the fetus. Early in pregnancy, the
test may need to be done with a full bladder.
Unlike x rays, ultrasound is safe to use during
pregnancy. It does not cause any known side-effects
that would harm the mother or baby.
Pregnant women usually will have their first ultrasound anytime between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation. In
normal cases, the technician is able to identify a fetal
heartbeat, which appears as a flashing light on the
screen. Closer to the due date, physicians use ultrasound to make sure the fetus is in the correct position
to exit the birth canal head first.
Sometimes an ultrasound will show that a fetus
has stopped growing, or a gestational sac has formed
without a fetus, and a miscarriage has occurred. Later
in pregnancy, it also may show that the child is in a
breech position, oriented feet first, which can cause a
difficult labor.
Tests for birth defects
Most obstetricians offer parents a variety of ways
to find out if their developing child might have birth
defects such as spina bifida and Down Syndrome. An
alpha fetoprotein screen can be done through a simple
blood test in the doctor’s office between the 16th and
18th week of gestation. It tells the odds that their child
will have a severe congenital anomaly. The test works
by measuring the level of alpha fetoprotein, a substance produced by a fetus with birth defects. Low
levels of alpha fetoprotein in the mother’s blood may
indicate Down’s Syndrome. In that case, the next step
for most couples is amniocentesis because the alpha
fetoprotein test can give false-positive results.
Amniocentesis is a more accurate test, but it also has
higher risks of complications.
This procedure typically is used to diagnose Down
syndrome while a developing child is still in the womb,
at 15-28 weeks.
During amniocentesis, a doctor inserts a needle
through a woman’s vaginal canal and inside her cervix. Using ultrasound as a guide, the doctor pierces the
uterus to withdraw a sample of fluid from the amniotic
sac. Afterwards, tiny cells shed by the fetus can be
studied in the laboratory. Scientists can analyze
DNA samples to determine if the fetus has Down
syndrome or other genetic conditions. Amniocentesis
also can determine the sex of the fetus.
Women who have a history of recurring miscarriages may not want to have this procedure.
Amniocentesis is usually performed in a doctor’s
office on an outpatient basis.
Common side effects include cramping and
bleeding.
In about one out of every 1,000 cases, amniocentesis causes a needle to puncture the uterine wall,
which could result in miscarriage.
In most cases, couples find out their baby does not
have a birth defect.
If the results come back positive for Down’s
Syndrome or other serious conditions, the couple
must decide if they want to end the pregnancy.
Others use the knowledge to plan and prepare any
special care needed for their future child.
Group B Strep
This test is for Group B streptococci (GBS)
infection.
By testing for GBS, physicians can determine if
a woman is at risk of passing this infection along to
her child.
Women who have had a prior child with GBS, or
who have a fever or prolonged or premature rupture of
the amniotic sac may be at higher risk for this type of
infection.
GBS is a type of bacteria commonly found in the
vagina and rectum. Unlike regular strep throat, GBS
can be present in a person’s body without causing any
symptoms, so many women do not realize they are
infected with it.
To test for the presence of GBS, doctors may take
a urine sample. They also may collect samples from the
vagina or rectum, which are then analyzed in a lab.
This test is usually performed late in pregnancy, at
35-37 weeks of gestation.
This is a routine urine test or pelvic exam with no
side effects.
In many cases, doctors do not find any evidence of
this type of infection.
If a woman is found to be infected with Group B
strep, physicians usually wait to treat it until just
before labor begins. At that time, they may give the
mother antibiotics so the baby is not born with the 
infection. Newborns who are exposed to Group B
strep can have inflammation of the brain, spinal
cord, blood or lungs. In some cases, this serious complication can result in infant death.
