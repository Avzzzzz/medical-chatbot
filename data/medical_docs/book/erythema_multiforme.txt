Definition
Erythema multiforme is a skin disease that causes
lesions and redness around the lesions.
Description
Erythema multiforme appears on the skin and the
mucous membranes (the lining of the mouth, digestive
tract, vagina, and other organs). Large, symmetrical
red blotches appear all over the skin in a circular
pattern. On mucous membranes, it begins as blisters
and progresses to ulcers. A more advanced form,
called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, can be severe and
even fatal.
Causes and symptoms
Erythema multiforme has many causes, most
commonly are drugs. Penicillin, sulfonamides, certain
epilepsy drugs, aspirin, and acetaminophen are the
most likely medication-induced causes. Erythema
multiforme can also be caused by certain diseases.
Herpes virus and mycoplasma pneumonia are likely
infectious causes.
Diagnosis
The appearance of the rash is sufficiently unique
to identify it on sight. Having identified it, the physician will determine the underlying cause.
Treatment
Erythema multiforme is inadvertently treated
when the causative agent, whether it be a drug or a
disease, is treated. In severe cases, cortisone-like medication is often used along with general supportive
measures and prevention of infection.
Prognosis
As a rule, the rash abates by itself without damaging the skin. Only in the case of infection, severe
blistering, or continued use of an offending drug
does complications occur.
