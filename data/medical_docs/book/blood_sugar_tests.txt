Definition
 Blood sugar tests include several different tests
 that measure the amount of sugar (glucose) in a per
son’s blood. These tests are performed either on an
 empty stomach, or after consuming a meal or pre
measured glucose drink. Blood sugar tests are done
 primarily to diagnose and evaluate a person with
 diabetes mellitus.
 Purpose
 Thebodyusessugar,alsocalled glucose,tosupply
 the energy it needs to function. People get sugar from
 their diet and from their body tissues. Insulin is made
 by the pancreas and affects the outer membrane of
 cells, making it easy for glucose to move from the
 blood into the cells. When insulin is active, blood
 glucose levels fall. Sugar from body tissues is stored  in the form of glycogen. When glycogen is active,
 blood glucose levels rise.
 After a meal, blood glucose levels rise sharply.
 The pancreas responds by releasing enough insulin to
 take care of all the newly added sugar found in the
 body. The insulin moves the sugar out of the blood
 andinto the cells. Only then does the blood sugar start
 to level off and begin to fall. A person with diabetes
 mellitus either does not make enough insulin, or
 makes insulin that does not work properly. The result
 is blood sugar that remains high, a condition called
 hyperglycemia.
 Diabetes must bediagnosedasearly aspossible. If
 left untreated, it can damage or cause failure of the
 eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, blood vessels, and other
 body organs. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, also
 may be discovered through blood sugar testing.
 Hypoglycemiaiscausedbyvarioushormonedisorders
 and liver disease, as well as by too much insulin.
 Description
 There are a variety of ways to measure a person’s
 blood sugar.
 Whole blood glucose test
 Whole blood glucose testing can be performed by
 a person in his or her home, and kits are available for
 this purpose. The person pricks his or her finger (a
 finger stick) with a sterile sharp blade from the kit. A
 single drop of blood is placed on a strip in a portable
 instrument called a glucometer. The glucometer
 quickly determines the blood sugar and shows the
 results on a small screen in usually a few seconds.
 New technologies for monitoring glucose levels
 will help diabetics better control their glucose levels.
 These tests are particularly important for children
 and adolescents. In mid-2002, the U.S. Food and
 Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new home
 test for use by children and adolescents (it had
 already been approved for adults) called the Cygnus
 GlucoWatch biographer that helped better detect
 hypoglycemia. Studies show that more frequent
 checks are better; new monitors such as this allow
 for simpler frequent testing. Continuous monitoring
 was in development in early 2004, as a company
 called TheraSense, Inc. received preapproval from
 the FDA for clinical trials on its home continuous
 glucose monitor. The monitor was designed to pro
vide users with real-time glucose data, alarms for
 hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and to show trends
 intheirbloodsugarlevels.
 The fasting plasma glucose test is done on an
 empty stomach. For the eight hours before the test,
 the person must fast (nothing to eat or drink, except
 water). The person’s blood is drawn from a vein by a
 health care worker. The blood sample is collected into
 a tube containing an anticoagulant. Anticoagulants
 stop the blood from clotting. In the laboratory, the
 tube of blood spins at high speed within a machine
 called a centrifuge. The blood cells sink to the bottom
 and the liquid stays on the top. This straw-colored
 liquid on the top is the plasma. To measure the
 glucose, a person’s plasma is combined with other
 substances. From the resulting reaction, the amount
 of glucose in the plasma is determined.
 Oral glucose tolerance test
 The oral glucose tolerance test is conducted to see
 how well the body handles a standard amount of
 glucose. This test measures the amount of glucose in
 a person’s plasma before and two hours after drinking
 a large premeasured beverage containing glucose. The
 person must eat a consistent diet, containing at least
 5.25 oz (150g) of carbohydrates each day, for three
 days before this test. For eight hours before the test,
 the person must fast. A health care provider draws the
 first sample of blood at the endofthe fasttodetermine
 the glucose level at the start of the test. The health care
 provider then gives the person a beverage containing
 2.6oz (75g) of glucose. Two hours later, the person’s
 blood is drawn again. These blood samples are centri
fuged and processed in the laboratory. A doctor can
 then compare the before and after glucose levels to see
 how well the patient’s body processed the sugar.
 Two-hour postprandial blood glucose test

 a specific meal containing a certain amount of sugar.
 Although the meal follows a predetermined menu, it is
 difficult to control many factors associated with this
 testing method.
 Blood sugar tests can be used in a variety of situa
tions including:
 Testing people suspected for diabetes. The American
 Diabetic Association (ADA) recommends that either
 a fasting plasma glucose test or an oral glucose toler
ance test be used to diagnose diabetes. If the person
 alreadyhassymptomsofdiabetes,abloodglucosetest
 without fasting (called a casual plasma glucose test)
 may be done. If the test result is abnormal, it must be
 confirmed with another test performed on another day. The two tests can be different or they can be the
 same, but they must be done on different days. If the
 second test also is abnormal, the person has diabetes.
 Atwo-hour postprandial test is not recommended by
 the ADAasatesttousefor the diagnosis of diabetes.
 A doctor may order this test, and follow it with the
 oral glucose tolerance test or the fasting plasma glu
cose test if the results are abnormal.
 Testing pregnant women. Diabetes that occurs dur
ing pregnancy (gestational diabetes) is dangerous for
 both the mother and the baby. Women who may be
 at risk are screened when they are 24-28 weeks preg
nant. A woman is considered at risk if she is older
 than 25years, is not at her normal bodyweight,hasa
 parent orsibling withdiabetes, orif sheis inanethnic
 group that has a high rate of diabetes (Hispanics,
 Native Americans, Asians, African Americans).
 The blood sugar test to screen for gestational dia
betes is a variation of the oral glucose tolerance test.
 Fasting is not required. If the result is abnormal,
 a more complete test is done on another day.
 Testing healthy people. Healthy people without
 symptoms of diabetes should be screened for dia
betes when they are 45 years old and again every
 three years. Either the fasting plasma glucose or
 oral glucose tolerance test is used for screening.
 People in high risk groups should be tested before
 the age of 45 and tested more frequently.
 Testing of people already diagnosed with diabetes.
 The ADA recommends that a person with diabetes
 keep the amount of glucose in the blood at a normal
 level as much as possible. This can be done by the
 diabetic person testing his or her own blood at home
 one or more times a day.
 Preparation
 Each blood sugar test that uses plasma requires a
 5 mL blood sample. A healthcare worker ties a tight
 band(tourniquet) on the person’s upper arm, locates a
 vein in the inner elbowregion, andinserts aneedle into
 the vein. Vacuum action draws the blood through the
 needle into an attached tube. Collection of the sample
 takes only a few minutes.
 When fasting is required, the person should have
 nothing to eat or drink (except water) for eight hours
 before the test and until the test or series of tests is
 completed. The person should not smoke before or
 during the testing period because this can temporarily
 increase the amount of glucose in the blood. Other
 factors that can cause inaccurate results are a change
 in diet before the test, illness or surgery two weeks
 before the test, certain drugs, and extended bed rest.
 The doctor may tell a person on insulin or taking pills
 for diabetes to stop the medication until after the test.
 Aftercare
 After the test or series of tests is completed (and
 with the approval of his or her doctor), the person
 should eat, drink, and take any medications that
 were stopped for the test.
 The patient may feel discomfort when blood is
 drawnfromavein.Bruisingmayoccuratthepuncture
 site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to
 the puncture site until the bleeding stops will reduce
 bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve
 discomfort.
 Risks
 If the person experiences weakness, fainting,
 sweating, or any other unusual reaction while fasting
 or during thetest, heor sheshouldimmediately tellthe
 person giving the test.
 Normal results
 Normal results are:
 fasting plasma glucose test less than 120 mg/dL
 oral glucose tolerance test, 2 hours less than 140 mg/dL
 For the diabetic person, the ADA recommends
 an ongoing blood sugar goal of less than or equal to
 120 mg/dL.
 Abnormal results
 These abnormal results indicate diabetes and
 must be confirmed with repeat testing:
 fasting plasma glucose test less than or equal to
 126 mg/dL
 oral glucose tolerance test, 2 hours less than or equal
 to 200 mg/dL
 casual plasma glucose test (nonfasting, with symp
toms) less than or equal to 200 mg/dL
 gestational oral glucose tolerance test, 1 hour less
 than or equal to 140 mg/dL
 Brain damagecanoccurfromglucoselevelsbelow
 40 mg/dL and coma from levels above 470 mg/dL.
 A condition known as prediabetes or impaired
 glucose tolerance, which may lead to Type 2 diabetes,
 usually is indicated with a reading of 100 mg/dL. Other
 hormone disorders can cause both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.Abnormal results must be interpreted by
 a doctor who is aware of the person’s medical condition
 and medical history.
