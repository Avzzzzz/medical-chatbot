Definition
 Beta2-microglobulin is a protein found on the sur
face of many cells. Testing is done primarily when
 evaluating a person for certain kinds of cancer affect
ing white blood cells including chronic lymphocytic
 leukemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and multiple
 myeloma or kidney disease. 
 Purpose
 Beta2-microglobulin is plentiful on the surface of
 white blood cells. Increased production or destruction
 of these cells causes Beta2-microglobulin levels in the
 blood to increase. This increase is seen in people with
 cancers involving white blood cells, but it is particu
larly meaningful in people newly diagnosed with mul
tiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a malignancy
 (cancer) of a certain kind of white blood cell, called a
 plasma cell. At the time of diagnosis, the Beta2-micro
globulin levels reflect how advanced the disease is and
 the likely prognosis for that person.
 When kidney disease is suspected, comparing
 blood and urine levels helps identify where the kidney
 is damaged. Beta2-microglobulin normally is filtered
 out of the blood by the kidney’s glomeruli (a round
 mass of capillary loops leading to each kidney tubule),
 only to be partially reabsorbed back into the blood
 when it reaches the kidney’s tubules. In glomerular
 kidney disease, the glomeruli can’t filter it out of the
 blood, so levels increase in the blood and decrease in
 the urine. In tubular kidney disease, the tubules can’t
 reabsorb it back into the blood, so urine levels rise and
 blood levels fall. After a kidney transplant, increased
 blood levels may be an early sign of rejection.  Increased urinary levels are found in people with
 kidney damage caused by high exposure to the heavy
 metals cadmium and mercury. Periodic testing of
 workers exposed to these metals helps to detect begin
ning kidney damage.
 Beta2-microglobulin levels also rise during infec
tion with some viruses, including cytomegalovirus and
 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Studies show
 that as HIV disease advances, beta2-microglobulin
 levels rise.
 Description
 Testing methods vary, but most involve adding
 the person’s serum–the yellow, liquid part of blood
or urine to one or more substances that bind to beta2
microglobulin in the serum or urine. The amount of
 the substance(s) bound to beta2-microglobulin is mea
sured and the original amount of beta2-microglobulin
 is determined.
 The test is covered by insurance when medically
 necessary. Results are usually available the next day.
 Preparation
 The blood test requires 5 mL of blood. A health
care worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s upper
 arm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and
 inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws
 the blood through the needle into an attached tube.
 Collection of the sample takes only a few minutes.
 Urine may be a single collection or collected
 throughout a 24-hour time period. The urine should
 be refrigerated until it is brought to the laboratory and
 must not become acidic.
 Aftercare
 Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
 site or the personmayfeeldizzyor faint.Pressuretothe
 puncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.
 Warmpacks on the puncture site relieve discomfort.
 Normal results
 Serum: less than or equ to 2.7 g/ml
 Urine: less than 1 mg 24 hours 0–160 g/L
 Abnormal results
 Themeaningofanabnormalresultvarieswiththe
 clinical condition of the person tested. In a person with
 multiple myeloma, ahigher level means apoorerprog
nosis than a lower level. In a person with kidney dis
ease, an increased blood level means the problem is
 tubular, not glomerular. In a kidney transplant
 patient, an increase may be a sign of rejection, toxic
 amounts of antirejection medication, or a viral infec
tion. An increased level in a worker exposed to cad
mium or mercury may signal beginning kidney
 damage and in a person with HIV, advancing disease.
