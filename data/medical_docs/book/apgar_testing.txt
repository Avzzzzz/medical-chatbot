Definition
Apgar testing is the assessment of the newborn
rating color, heart rate, stimulus response, muscle
tone, and respirations on a scale of zero to two, for a
maximum possible score of 10. It is performed twice,
first at one minute and then again at five minutes after
birth.
Purpose
Apgar scoring was originally developed in the
1950s by the anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar to assist
practitioners attending a birth in deciding whether or
not a newborn was in need of resuscitation. Using a
scoring method fosters consistency and standardization among different practitioners. A February 2001
study published in the New England Journal of
Medicine investigated whether Apgar scoring continues to be relevant. Researchers concluded that
‘‘The Apgar scoring system remains as relevant for
the prediction of neonatal survival today as it was
almost 50 years ago.’’
Description
The five areas are scored as follows:
 Appearance, or color: 2 if the skin is pink all over; 1
for acrocyanosis, where the trunk and head are pink,
but the arms and legs are blue; and 0 if the whole
body is blue. Newborns with naturally darker skin
color will not be pink. However, pallor is still noticeable, especially in the soles and palms. Color is
related to the neonate’s ability to oxygenate its
body and extremities, and is dependent on heart
rate and respirations. A perfectly healthy newborn
will often receive a score of 9 because of some blueness in the hands and feet.
 Pulse (heart rate): 2 for a pulse of 100+ beats per
minute (bpm); 1 for a pulse below 100 bpm; 0 for no
pulse. Heart rate is assessed by listening with a
stethoscope to the newborn’s heart and counting
the number of beats.
 Grimace, or reflex irritability: 2 if the neonate
coughs, sneezes, or vigorously cries in response to a
stimulus (such as the use of nasal suctioning, stroking
the back to assess for spinal abnormalities, or having
the foot tapped); 1 for a slight cry or grimace in
response to the stimulus; 0 for no response.
 Activity, or muscle tone: 2 for vigorous movements
of arms and legs; 1 for some movement; 0 for no
movement, limpness.
 Respirations: 2 for visible breathing and crying; 1
for slow, weak, irregular breathing; 0 for apnea,
or no breathing. A crying newborn can adequately oxygenate its lungs. Respirations are best
assessed by watching the rise and fall of the neonate’s abdomen, as infants are diaphragmatic
breathers.
The combined first letters in these five areas spell
Apgar.
Preparation
No preparation is needed to perform the test.
However, while being born the neonate may receive
nasal and oral suctioning to remove mucus and
amniotic fluid. This may be done when the head of
the newborn is safely out, while the mother rests
before she continues to push.
Aftercare
Since the test is primarily observational in nature,
no aftercare is needed. However, the test may flag the
need for immediate intervention or prolonged
observation.
Normal results
The maximum possible score is 10, the minimum
is zero. It is rare to receive a true 10, as some acrocyanosis in the newborn is considered normal, and therefore not a cause for concern. Most infants score
between 7 and 10. These infants are expected to have
an excellent outcome. A score of 4, 5, or 6 requires
immediate intervention, usually in the form of oxygen
and respiratory assistance, or perhaps just suctioning
if breathing has been obstructed by mucus. While
suctioning is being done, a source of oxygen may be
placed near, but not over the newborn’s nose and
mouth. This form of oxygen is referred to as blow-by.
A score in the 4-6 range indicates that the neonate is
having some difficulty adapting to extrauterine life.
This may be due to medications given to the mother
during a difficult labor, or at the very end of labor,
when these medications have an exaggerated effect on
the neonate.
Abnormal results
With a score of 0-3, the newborn is unresponsive,
apneic, pale, limp and may not have a pulse.
Interventions to resuscitate will begin immediately.
The test is repeated at five minutes after birth and
both scores are documented. Should the resuscitation
effort continue into the five-minute time period, interventions will not stop in order to perform the test. The
one-minute score indicates the need for intervention at
birth. It addresses survival and prevention of birthrelated complications resulting from inadequate
oxygen supply. Poor oxygenation may be due to
inadequate neurological and/or chemical control of
respiration. The five-minute score appears to have a
more predictive value for morbidity and normal development, although research studies on this are inconsistent in their conclusions.
