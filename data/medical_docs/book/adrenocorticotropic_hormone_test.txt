Definition
Adrenocorticotropic hormone test (also known as
an ACTH test or a corticotropin test) measures pituitary gland function.
Purpose
The pituitary gland produces the hormone
ACTH, which stimulates the outer layer of the adrenal
gland (the adrenal cortex). ACTH causes the release of
the hormones hydrocortisone (cortisol), aldosterone,
and androgen. The most important of these hormones
released is cortisol. The ACTH test is used to determine if too much cortisol is being produced (Cushing’s
syndrome) or if not enough cortisol is being produced
(Addison’s disease).
Precautions
ACTH has diurnal variation, meaning that the
levels of this hormone vary according to the time of
day. The highest levels occur in the morning hours.
Testing for normal secretion, as well as for Cushing’s
disease, may require multiple samples. For sequential
follow-up, a blood sample analyzed for ACTH should
always be drawn at the same time each day.
ACTH can be directly measured by an analyzing
method (immunoassay) in many large laboratories.
However, smaller laboratories are usually not
equipped to perform this test and they may need to
send the blood sample to a larger laboratory. Because
of this delay, results may take several days to obtain.
Description
ACTH production is partly controlled by an area
in the center of the brain (the hypothalamus) and partly
controlled by the level of cortisol in the blood. When
ACTH levels are too high, cortisol production increases
to suppress ACTH release from the pituitary gland. If
ACTH levels are too low, the hypothalamus produces
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to stimulate
the pituitary gland to make more ACTH. ACTH levels
rise in response to stress, emotions, injury, infection,
burns, surgery, and decreased blood pressure.
Cushing’s syndrome
Cushing’s syndrome is caused by an abnormally
high level of circulating hydrocortisone. The high level
may be the result of an adrenal gland tumor or enlargement of both adrenal glands due to a pituitary
tumor. The high level of hydrocortisone may be the
result of taking corticosteroid drugs for a long time.
Corticosteroid drugs are widely used for inflammation
in disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory
bowel disease, and asthma.
Addison’s disease
Addison’s disease is a rare disorder in which
symptoms are caused by a deficiency of hydrocortisone and aldosterone. The most common cause of
this disease is an autoimmune disorder. The immune
system normally fights foreign invaders in the body
like bacteria. In an autoimmune disorder, the
immune systems attacks the body. In this case, the
immune system produces antibodies that attack
the adrenal glands. Addison’s disease generally progresses slowly, with symptoms developing gradually
over months or years. However, acute episodes,
called Addisonian crises, are brought on by infection,
injury, or other stresses. Diagnosis is generally made
if the patient fails to respond to an injection of
ACTH, which normally stimulates the secretion of
hydrocortisone.
Preparation
A person’s ACTH level is determined from a
blood sample. The patient must fast from midnight
until the test the next morning. This means that the
patient cannot eat or drink anything after midnight
except water. The patient must also avoid radioisotope scanning tests or recently administered radioisotopes prior to the blood test.
Risks
The risks associated with this test are minimal.
They may include slight bleeding from the location
where the blood was drawn. The patient may feel faint
or lightheaded after the blood is drawn. Sometimes
the patient may have an accumulation of blood
under the puncture site (hematoma) after the test.
Normal results
Each laboratory will have its own set of normal
values for this test. The normal values can range from:
Morning (4-8 A.M.) 8-100 pg/mL or 10-80 ng/L (SI
units) Evening (8-10 P.M.) less than 50 pg/mL or less
than 50 ng/L (SI units)
Abnormal results
In Cushing’s syndrome, high levels of ACTH may
be caused by ACTH-producing tumors. These tumors
may be either in the pituitary or in another area (like
tumors from lung cancer or ovarian cancer). Low
ACTH levels may be caused by adrenal enlargement
due to high levels of cortisol and feedback to the
pituitary.
In Addison’s disease, high levels of ACTH may be
caused by adrenal gland diseases. These diseases
decrease adrenal hormones and the pituitary attempts
to increase functioning. Low levels of ACTH may
occur because of decreased pituitary function.
