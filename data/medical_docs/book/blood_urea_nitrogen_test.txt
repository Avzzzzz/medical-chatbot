 Definition
 The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test measures the
 level of urea nitrogen in a sample of the patient’s
 blood. Urea is a substance that is formed in the liver
 when the body breaks down protein. Urea then circu
lates in the blood in the form of urea nitrogen. In
 healthy people, most urea nitrogen is filtered out by
 the kidneys and leaves the body in the urine. If the
 patient’s kidneys are not functioning properly or if the
 body is using large amounts of protein, the BUN level
 will rise. If the patient has severe liver disease, the BUN
 will drop.
 Purpose
 The BUNlevel may be checked in order to assess
 or monitor:
 the presence orprogression ofkidneyorliver disease.
 blockage of urine flow.
 mental confusion. Patients with kidney failure are
 sometimes disoriented and confused.
 abnormal loss of water from the body (dehydration).
 recovery from severe burns. The body uses larger
 than normal amounts of protein following serious
 burns.
 Description
 The BUN test is performed on a sample of the
 patient’s blood, withdrawn from a vein into a vacuum
 tube. The procedure, which is called a venipuncture,
 takes about five minutes.
 Preparation
 The doctor should check to make sure that the
 patient is not taking any medications that can affect
 BUNresults.Thesedrugsinclude theantibiotics chlor
amphenicol, streptomycin, amphotericin B, methicil
lin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin, as well
 as diuretics and corticosteroids.
 The patient should be advised not to eat large
 amounts of meat the day before the test.
 Aftercare
 Aftercare consists of routine care of the area
 around the venipuncture. 
  Risks
 The primary risk is the possibility of a bruise or
 swelling in the area of the venipuncture. The patient
 can apply moist warm compresses.
 Normal results
 Normal BUN levels are 5-18 mg/dL for children;
 7-18 mg/dL for adults; and 8-20 mg/dL in the elderly.
 Abnormal results
 BUNlevels can be too low as well as too high.
 Abnormally low BUN
 Low levels of BUN may indicate overhydration,
 malnutrition, celiac disease [a disease characterized by
 the inability ot tolerate foods containing wheat pro
tein (gluten)], liver damage or disease, or use of corti
costeroids. Low BUN may also occur in early
 pregnancy.
 Abnormally high BUN
 Highlevels ofBUNmayindicatekidneydiseaseor
 failure; blockage of the urinary tract by a kidney stone
 or tumor; a heart attack or congestive heart failure;
 dehydration; fever; shock; or bleeding in the digestive
 tract. High BUN levels can sometimes occur during
 late pregnancy or result from eating large amounts of
 protein-rich foods. A BUN level higher than 100 mg/
 dL points to severe kidney damage.
