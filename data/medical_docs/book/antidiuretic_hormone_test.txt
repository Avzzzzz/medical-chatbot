Definition
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) test, also called the
Vasopressin test, is a test for the antidiuretic hormone,
which is released from the pituitary gland and acts on
the kidneys to increase their reabsorption of water into
the blood.
Purpose
An ADH test is used to aid in the diagnosis of
diabetes insipidus or the syndrome of inappropriate
ADH called SIADH.
Precautions
Certain drugs can either increase or decrease
ADH levels. Drugs that increase ADH levels include
acetaminophen, barbiturates, cholinergic agents, estrogen, nicotine, oral hypoglycemia agents, some diuretics
(e.g., thiazides), cyclophosphamide, narcotics, and tricyclic antidepressants. Drugs that decrease ADH levels
include alcohol, beta-adrenergic agents, morphine
antagonists, and phenytoin (Dilantin).
Description
The purpose of ADH is to control the amount of
water reabsorbed by the kidneys. Water is continually being taken into the body in food and drink, as
well as being produced by chemical reactions in cells.
Water is also continually lost in urine, sweat, feces,
and in the breath as water vapor. ADH release helps
maintain the optimum amount of water in the body
when there is an increase in the concentration of the
blood serum or a decrease in blood volume. Physical
stress, surgery, and high levels of anxiety can also
stimulate ADH.
Various factors can affect ADH production,
thereby disturbing the bodyâ€™s water balance. For
example, alcohol consumption reduces ADH production by direct action on the brain, resulting in a
temporarily increased production of urine. This may
also occur in diabetes insipidus, when the pituitary
gland produces insufficient ADH, or rarely, when the
kidneys fail to respond to ADH. The reverse effect of
water retention can result from temporarily
increased ADH production after a major operation
or accident. Water retention may also be caused by
the secretion of ADH by some tumors, especially of
the lung.
Preparation
The test requires collection of a blood sample. The
patient must be fasting (nothing to eat or drink) for
12 hours, be adequately hydrated, and limit physical
activity for 10-12 hours before the test.
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or
feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma
(blood accumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results
ADH normal ranges are laboratory-specific but
can range from 1-5 pg/ml or 1.5 ng/L (SI units).
Abnormal results
Patients who are dehydrated, who have a decreased
amount of blood in the body (hypovolemia), or who are
undergoing severe physical stress (e.g., trauma, pain or
prolonged mechanical ventilation) may exhibit increased
ADH levels. Patients who are overly hydrated or who
have an increased amount of blood in the body (hypervolemia) may have decreased ADH levels.
Other conditions that cause increased levels
include SIADH, central nervous system tumors or
infection, or pneumonia.
