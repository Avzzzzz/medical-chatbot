Definition
The Aspartate aminotransferase test measures
levels of AST, an enzyme released into the blood
when certain organs or tissues, particularly the liver
and heart, are injured. Aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) is also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic
transaminase (SGOT).
Purpose
The determination of AST levels aids primarily in
the diagnosis of liver disease. In the past, the AST test
was used to diagnose heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI) but more accurate blood tests have largely
replaced it for cardiac purposes.
Description
AST is determined by analysis of a blood sample,
usually from taken from a venipuncture site at the
bend of the elbow.
AST is found in the heart, liver, skeletal muscle,
kidney, pancreas, spleen, lung, red blood cells, and
brain tissue. When disease or injury affects these
tissues, the cells are destroyed and AST is released
into the bloodstream. The amount of AST is directly
related to the number of cells affected by the disease
or injury, but the level of elevation depends on the
length of time that the blood is tested after the
injury. Serum AST levels become elevated eight
hours after cell injury, peak at 24-36 hours, and
return to normal in three to seven days. If the
cellular injury is chronic (ongoing), AST levels will
remain elevated.
One of the most important uses for AST determination has formerly been in the diagnosis of a heart
attack, or MI. AST can assist in determining the
timing and extent of a recent MI, although it is less
specific than creatine phosphokinase (CPK), CKMB,
myglobin, troponins, and lactic dehydrogenase
(LDH). Assuming no further cardiac injury occurs,
the AST level rises within 6-10 hours after an acute
attack, peaks at 12-48 hours, and returns to normal
in three to four days. Myocardial injuries such as
angina (chest pain) or pericarditis (inflammation of
the pericardium, the membrane around the heart) do
not increase AST levels.
AST is also a valuable aid in the diagnosis of liver
disease. Although not specific for liver disease, it can
be used in combination with other enzymes to monitor
the course of various liver disorders. Chronic, silent
hepatitis (hepatitis C) is sometimes the cause of elevated AST. In alcoholic hepatitis, caused by excessive
alcohol ingestion, AST values are usually moderately
elevated; in acute viral hepatitis, AST levels can rise to
over 20 times normal. Acute extrahepatic (outside the
liver) obstruction (e.g. gallstone), produces AST levels
that can quickly rise to 10 times normal, and then
rapidly fall. In cases of cirrhosis, the AST level is
related to the amount of active inflammation of the
liver. Determination of AST also assists in early recognition of toxic hepatitis that results from exposure to
drugs toxic to the liver, like acetaminophen and
cholesterol lowering medications.
Other disorders or diseases in which the AST
determination can be valuable include acute
pancreatitis, muscle disease, trauma, severe burn, and
infectious mononucleosis.
Preparation
The physician may require discontinuation of any
drugs that might affect the test. These types include
such drugs as antihypertensives (for treatment of
high blood pressure), coumarin-type anticoagulants
(blood-thinning drugs), digitalis, erythromycin (an
antibiotic), oral contraceptives, and opiates, among
others. The patient may also need to cut back on
strenuous activities temporarily, because exercise can
also elevate AST for a day or two.
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or
feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma
(blood accumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results
Normal ranges for the AST are laboratoryspecific, but can range from 3-45 units/L (units per
liter).
Abnormal results
Striking elevations of AST (400-4000 units/L) are
found in almost all forms of acute hepatic necrosis,
such as viral hepatitis and carbon tetrachloride poisoning. In alcoholics, even moderate doses of the analgesic
acetaminophen have caused extreme elevations
(1, 960-29, 700 units/L). Moderate rises of AST are
seen in jaundice, cirrhosis, and metastatic carcinoma.
Approximately 80% of patients with infectious mononucleosis show elevations in the range of 100-600
units/L.
