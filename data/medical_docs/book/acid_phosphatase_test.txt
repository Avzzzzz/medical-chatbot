Acid phosphatase is an enzyme found throughout
the body, but primarily in the prostate gland. Like all
enzymes, it is needed to trigger specific chemical reactions. Acid phosphatase testing is done to diagnose
whether prostate cancer has spread to other parts of
the body (metastasized), and to check the effectiveness
of treatment. The test has been largely supplanted by
the prostate specific antigen test (PSA).
Purpose
The male prostate gland has 100 times more
acid phosphatase than any other body tissue.
When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the
body, acid phosphatase levels rise, particularly if
the cancer spreads to the bone. One-half to threefourths of persons who have metastasized prostate
cancer have high acid phosphatase levels. Levels fall
after the tumor is removed or reduced through
treatment.
Tissues other than prostate have small amounts
of acid phosphatase, including bone, liver, spleen,
kidney, and red blood cells and platelets. Damage to
these tissues causes a moderate increase in acid phosphatase levels.
Acid phosphatase is very concentrated in semen.
Rape investigations will often include testing for the
presence of acid phosphatase in vaginal fluid.
Precautions
This is not a screening test for prostate cancer.
Acid phosphatase levels rise only after prostate cancer
has metastasized.
Description
Laboratory testing measures the amount of acid
phosphatase in a person’s blood, and can determine
from what tissue the enzyme is coming. For example, it
is important to know if the increased acid phosphatase
is from the prostate or red blood cells. Acid phosphatase from the prostate, called prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), is the most medically significant type of
acid phosphatase.
Subtle differences between prostatic acid phosphatase and acid phosphatases from other tissues
cause them to react differently in the laboratory
when mixed with certain chemicals. For example,
adding the chemical tartrate to the test mixture inhibits the activity of prostatic acid phosphatase but not
red blood cell acid phosphatase. Laboratory test
methods based on these differences reveal how
much of a person’s total acid phosphatase is derived
from the prostate. Results are usually available the
next day.
Preparation
This test requires drawing about 5-10 mL of blood.
The patient should not have a rectal exam or prostate
massage for two to three days prior to the test.
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site, and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Applying
pressure to the puncture site until the bleeding stops
will reduce bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site
will relieve discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results vary based on the laboratory and
the method used.
Abnormal results
The highest levels of acid phosphatase are found
in metastasized prostate cancer. Diseases of the
bone, such as Paget’s disease or hyperparathyroidism;
diseases of blood cells, such as sickle cell disease or
multiple myeloma; or lysosomal disorders, such as
Gaucher’s disease, will show moderately increased
levels.
Certain medications can cause temporary increases
or decreases in acid phosphatase levels. Manipulation
of the prostate gland through massage, biopsy, or rectal
exam before a test can increase the level.
