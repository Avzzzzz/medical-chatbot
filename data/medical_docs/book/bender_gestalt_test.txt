 Definition
 The Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test (or Bender
Gestalt test) is a psychological assessment used to
 evaluate visual-motor functioning, visual-perceptual
 skills, neurological impairment, and emotional distur
bances in children and adults ages three and older.
 The Bender-Gestalt is used to evaluate visual
motor maturity and to screen children for develop
mental delays. The test is also used to assess brain
 damage and neurological deficits. Individuals who
 have suffered a traumatic brain injury may be given
 the Bender-Gestalt as part of a battery of neuropsy
chological measures, or tests.
 The Bender-Gestalt is sometimes used in conjunc
tion with other personality tests to determine the pre
sence of emotional and psychiatric disturbances such
 as schizophrenia.
 Precautions
 Psychometric testing requires a clinically trained
 examiner. The Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test
 should be administered and interpreted by a trained
 psychologistorpsychiatrist.TheBender-Gestaltshould
 always be employed as only one element of a complete
 battery of psychological or developmental tests, and
 should never be used alone as the sole basis for a
 diagnosis.
 Description
 Theoriginal BenderVisualMotorGestalttestwas
 developed in 1938 by psychiatrist Lauretta Bender.
 There are several different versions of the Bender
Gestalt available today (i.e., the Bender-Gestalt test;
 Modified Version of the Bender-Gestalt test for
 Preschool and Primary School Children; the Hutt
 Adaptation of the Bender-Gestalt test; the Bender
 Visual Motor Gestalt test for Children; the Bender
Gestalt test for Young Children; the Watkins Bender
Gestalt Scoring System; the Canter Background
 Interference Procedure for the Bender-Gestalt test).
 All use the same basic test materials, but vary in their
 scoring and interpretation methods.
 The standard Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test
 consists of nine figures, each on its own 3 x 5 card. An
 examiner presents each figure to the test subject one at
 a time and asks the subject to copy it onto a single
 piece of blank paper. The only instruction given to the
 subject is that he or she should make the best repro
duction of the figure possible. The test is not timed,
 although standard administration time is typically
 10-20 minutes. After testing is complete, the results
 are scored based on accuracy and organization.
 Interpretation depends on the form of the test in use.
 Common features considered in evaluating the draw
ings are rotation, distortion, symmetry, and persevera
tion. As an example, a patient with frontal lobe injury  may reproduce the same pattern over and over
 (perserveration).
 The Bender-Gestalt can also be administered in a
 group setting. In group testing, the figures are shown
 to test subjects with a slide projector, in a test booklet,
 or on larger versions of the individual test cards. Both
 the individual and group- administered Bender
Gestalt evaluation may take place in either an out
patient or hospital setting. Patients should check
 with their insurance plans to determine if these or
 other mental health services are covered.
 Normal results
 Children normally improve inthis test as they age,
 but, because of the complexity of the scoring process,
 results for the Bender-Gestalt should only be inter
preted by a clinically trained psychologist or
 psychiatrist.
