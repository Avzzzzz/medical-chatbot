Definition
Allergy tests indicate a person’s allergic sensitivity
to commonly encountered environmental substances.
Purpose
Allergy is a reaction of the immune system.
Normally, the immune system responds to foreign
microorganisms and particles, like pollen or dust,
by producing specific proteins called antibodies that
are capable of binding to identifying molecules, or
antigens, on the foreign organisms. This reaction
between antibody and antigen sets off a series of
reactions designed to protect the body from infection. Sometimes, this same series of reactions is
triggered by harmless, everyday substances. This is
the condition known as allergy, and the offending
substance is called an allergen. Common inhaled
allergens include pollen, dust, and insect parts from
tiny house mites. Common food allergens include
nuts, fish, and milk.
Allergic reactions involve a special set of cells
in the immune system known as mast cells. Mast
cells serve as guards in the tissues where the body
meets the outside world: the skin, the mucous
membranes of the eyes and other areas, and the linings of the respiratory and digestive systems. Mast
cells display a special type of antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside,
mast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets,
called granules. When the antibodies encounter allergens, they trigger the release of granules, which spill
out their chemicals onto neighboring cells, including
blood vessels and nerve cells. One of these chemicals,
histamine, binds to the surfaces of these other cells,
through special proteins called histamine receptors.
Interaction of histamine with receptors on blood
vessels causes neighboring cells to become leaky,
leading to the fluid collection, swelling, and increased
redness characteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated eyes. Histamine also stimulates pain receptors,
causing the itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat
common in allergic rhinitis.
The particular allergens to which a person is sensitive can be determined through allergy testing.
Allergy tests may be performed on the skin or using
blood serum in a test tube. During skin tests, potential
allergens are placed on the skin and the reaction
is observed. In radio-allergosorbent allergy testing
(RAST), a patient’s blood serum is combined
with allergen in a test tube to determine if serum antibodies react with the allergen. Provocation testing
involves direct exposure to a likely allergen, either
through inhalation or ingestion. Positive reactions
from any of these tests may be used to narrow the
candidates for the actual allergen causing the allergy.
Identification of the allergenic substance may
allow the patient to avoid the substance and reduce
allergic reactions. In addition, allergy testing may
be done in those with asthma that is difficult to
manage, eczema, or skin rashes to determine if an
allergy is causing the condition or making it worse.
Allergy tests may also be done before allergen desensitization to ensure the safety of more extensive exposure.
Skin testing is the most common type of allergy test.
There are two forms: percutaneous and intradermal. In
percutaneous or prick testing, allergen solutions are
placed on the skin, and the skin is then pricked with a
needle, allowing the allergen to enter the skin and
become exposed to mast cells. Scratch testing, in which
the skin is scratched instead of punctured, is used less
often. Intradermal testing involves directly injecting
allergen solutions into the skin. In both tests, a reddened,
swollen spot develops at the injection site for each
substance to which the person is sensitive. Skin reactivity
is seen for allergens regardless of whether they usually
affect the skin. In other words, airborne and food allergens cause skin reactions equally well.
The range of allergens used for testing is chosen to
reflect possible sources in the environment and may
include the following:

pollen from a variety of trees, common grasses, and
weeds

mold and fungus spores

house dust

house mites

animal skin cells (dander) and saliva

food extracts

antibiotics

insect venoms
Radio-allergosorbent testing (RAST) is a laboratory test performed when a person may be too sensitive to risk skin testing or when medications or skin
conditions prevent it.
Provocation testing is done to positively identify
suspected allergens after preliminary skin testing.
A purified preparation of the allergen is inhaled or
ingested in increasing concentrations to determine if
it will provoke a response. In 2004, scientists introduced an optical method to continuously measure the
changes in nasal mucosa (lining) changes with an
infrared light to help improve the accuracy of provocation testing. Food testing is much more tedious than
inhalation testing, since full passage through the digestive system may take a day or more.
Precautions
While allergy tests are quite safe for most people,
the possibility of a condition known as anaphylaxis
exists. Anaphylaxis is a potentially dangerous condition that can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp
drop in blood pressure. People with a known history
of anaphylaxis should inform the testing clinician.
Skin tests should never include a substance known to
cause anaphylaxis in the person being tested.
Provocation tests may cause an allergic reaction.
Therefore, treatment medications should be available
following the tests, to be administered, if needed.
Description
In prick testing, a drop of each allergen to be tested
is placed on the skin, usually on the forearm or the back.
A typical battery of tests may involve two dozen allergen
drops, including a drop of saline solution that should
not provoke a reaction (negative control) and a drop of
histamine that should provoke a reaction (positive control). A small needle is inserted through the drop, and
used to prick the skin below. A new needle is used for
each prick. The sites are examined over the next 20 minutes for evidence of swelling and redness, indicating a
positive reaction. In some instances, a tracing of the set
of reactions may be made by placing paper over
the tested area. Similarly, in intradermal testing, separate injections are made for each allergen tested.
Observations are made over the next 20 minutes.
In RAST testing, a blood sample is taken for use in
the laboratory, where the antibody- containing serum
is separated from the blood cells. The serum is then
exposed to allergens bound to a solid medium. If a
person has antibodies to a particular allergen, those
antibodies will bind to the solid medium and remain
behind after a rinse. Location of allergen-antibody combinations is done by adding antibody-reactive antibodies, so called anti-antibodies, that are chemically linked
with a radioactive dye. By locating radioactive spots on
the solid medium, the reactive allergens are discovered.
Provocation testing may be performed to identify
airborne or food allergens. Inhalation testing is performed only after a patient’s lung capacity and
response to the medium used to dilute the allergen
has been determined. Once this has been determined,
the patient inhales increasingly concentrated samples
of a particular allergen, followed each time by measurement of the exhalation capacity. Only one allergen
is tested per day. Testing for food allergies is usually
done by removing the suspect food from the diet for
two weeks, followed by eating a single portion of the
suspect food and follow-up monitoring
Preparation
Skin testing is preceded by a brief examination of
the skin. The patient should refrain from using antiallergy drugs for at least 48 hours before testing. Prior
to inhalation testing, patients with asthma who can
tolerate it may be asked to stop any asthma medications.
Testing for food allergies requires the person to avoid
all suspect food for at least two weeks before testing.
Aftercare
Skin testing does not usually require any aftercare.
A generalized redness and swelling may occur in the test
area, but it will usually resolve within a day or two.
Inhalation tests may cause delayed asthma
attacks, even if the antigen administered in the test
initially produced no response. Severe initial reactions
may justify close professional observation for at least
12 hours after testing.
Risks
Intradermal testing may inadvertently result in
the injection of the allergen into the circulation, with
an increased risk of adverse reactions. Inhalation tests
may provoke an asthma attack. Exposure to new or
unsuspected allergens in any test carries the risk of
anaphylaxis. Because patients are monitored following allergy testing, an anaphylactic reaction is usually
recognized and treated promptly. Occasionally, a
delayed anaphylactic response can occur that will
require immediate care. Proper patient education
regarding how to recognize anaphylaxis is vital.
Normal results
Lack of redness or swelling on a skin test indicates
no allergic response. In an inhalation test, the exhalation capacity should remain unchanged. In a food
challenge, no symptoms should occur.
Abnormal results
Presence of redness or swelling, especially over
5 mm (1/4 inch) in diameter, indicates an allergic
response. This does not mean the substance actually
causes the patient’s symptoms, however, since he or
she may have no regular exposure to the allergen. In
fact, the actual allergen may not have been included in
the test array.
Following allergen inhalation, reduction in exhalation capacity of more than 20%, and for at least 10-20
minutes, indicates a positive reaction to the allergen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms within 24 hours
following the ingestion of a suspected food allergen
indicates a positive response.
