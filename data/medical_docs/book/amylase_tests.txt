Definition
Amylase is a digestive enzyme made primarily by
the pancreas and salivary glands. Enzymes are substances made and used by the body to trigger specific
chemical reactions. The primary function of the
enzyme amylase is to break down starches in food so
that they can be used by the body. Amylase testing
is usually done to determine the cause of sudden
abdominal pain.
Purpose
Amylase testing is performed to diagnose a number of diseases that elevate amylase levels. Pancreatitis,
for example, is the most common reason for a high
amylase level. When the pancreas is inflamed, amylase
escapes from the pancreas into the blood. Within six to
48 hours after the pain begins, amylase levels in the
blood start to rise. Levels will stay high for several days
before gradually returning to normal.
There are other causes of increased amylase. An
ulcer that erodes tissue from the stomach and goes
into the pancreas will cause amylase to spill into the
blood. During a mumps infection, amylase from the
inflamed salivary glands increases. Amylase is also
found in the liver, fallopian tubes, and small intestine;
inflammation of these tissues also increases levels. Gall
bladder disease, tumors of the lung or ovaries, alcohol
poisoning, ruptured aortic aneurysm, and intestinal
strangulation or perforation can also cause unusually
high amylase levels.
Precautions
This is not a screening test for future pancreatic
disease.
Description
Amylase testing is done on both blood and
urine. The laboratory may use any of several testing
methods that involve mixing the blood or urine sample with a substance with which amylase is known to
react. By measuring the end-product or the reaction
time, technicians can calculate the amount of amylase present in the sample. More sophisticated methods separately measure the amylase made by the
pancreas and the amylase made by the salivary
glands.
Urine testing is a better long-term monitor of
amylase levels. The kidneys quickly move extra
amylase from the blood into the urine. Urine levels
rise six to 10 hours after blood levels and stay high
longer. Urine is usually collected throughout a 2- or
24-hour time period. Results are usually available the
same day.
Preparation
In most cases, no special preparation is necessary
for a person undergoing an amylase blood test.
Patients taking longer term urine amylase tests will
be given a container and instructions for collecting
the urine at home. The urine should be refrigerated
until it is brought to the laboratory.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to
the puncture site until the bleeding stops reduces
bruising. Applying warm packs to the puncture site
relieves discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results vary based on the laboratory and
the method used.
Abnormal results
Eight out of ten persons with acute pancreatitis
will have high amylase levels, up to four times the
normal level. Other causes of increased amylase, such
as mumps, kidney failure, pregnancy occurring in
the abdomen but outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy), certain tumors, a penetrating ulcer, certain
complications of diabetes, and advanced pancreatic
cancer, are further investigated based on the personâ€™s
symptoms, medical history, and the results of other
tests.
In kidney disease, the kidneys are not as efficient
at removing amylase from the blood. Amylase rises in
the blood, but stays at normal levels in the urine.
People with macroamylasia have large clumps of
amylase in their blood. These clumps are too large to
move through the kidney, so they stay in the blood.
Amylase levels in the blood will be high; levels in the
urine will be low.
Amylase levels may be low in severe liver disease
(including hepatitis), conditions in which the pancreas
fails to secrete enough enzyme for proper digestions
(pancreatic insufficiency), when toxic materials build
up in the blood during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia),
following burns, in thyroid disorders, and in advanced
cystic fibrosis. Some medications can raise or lower
levels.
