Definition
The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is a test done
early in the evaluation of a person for autoimmune or
rheumatic disease, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Purpose
In autoimmune diseases, the body makes antibodies that work against its own cells or tissues.
Rheumatic diseases (diseases that affect connective
tissue, including the joints, bone, and muscle) are
also associated with these antibodies. Autoantibodies
are proteins built by the body, but instead of guarding
against foreign material (including bacteria, viruses,
and fungi) as normal antibodies do, they attack the
body’s own cells.
Autoimmune and rheumatic diseases can be difficult to diagnose. People with the same disease can
have very different symptoms. A helpful strategy in
the diagnosis of these diseases is to find and identify an
autoantibody in the person’s blood.
The antinuclear antibody test looks for a
group of autoantibodies that attack substances
found in the center (nucleus) of all cells. It is useful
as a screen for many autoantibodies associated
with diseases that affect the entire body (systemic
diseases).
This test is particularly useful when diagnosing a
person with symptoms of SLE, an illness that affects
many body organs and tissues. If the test is negative, it
is unlikely that the person has SLE; if the test is positive,
more tests are done to confirm whether the person has
SLE or another related disease. Other diseases, such as
scleroderma, Sjo¨gren’s syndrome, Raynaud’s disease,
rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune hepatitis, often
have a positive test for antinuclear antibodies.
Description
Five to 10 mL of blood is needed for this test. The
antinuclear antibody test is done by adding a person’s
serum to commercial cells mounted on a microscope
slide. If antinuclear antibodies are in the serum, they
bind to the nuclei of cells on the slide. Next, a second
antibody is added to the mixture. This antibody is
‘‘tagged’’ with a fluorescent dye so that it can be
seen. The second antibody attaches to any antibodies
and cells bound together and, because of the fluorescent ‘‘tag,’’ the areas with antinuclear antibodies seem
to glow, or fluoresce, when the slide is viewed under an
ultraviolet microscope.
If fluorescent cells are seen, the test is positive.
When positive, the serum is diluted, or titered, and
the test done again. These steps are repeated until the
serum is so dilute it no longer gives a positive result.
The last dilution that shows fluorescence is the titer
reported.
The pattern of fluorescence within the cells gives
the physician clues as to what the disease might be.
The test result includes the titer and the pattern.
This test is also called the fluorescent antinuclear
antibody test or FANA. Results are available within
one to three days.Preparation
No special preparations or diet changes are
required before a person undergoes an antinuclear
antibody test.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to
the puncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising. Warm packs relieve discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results will be negative, showing no antinuclear antibodies.
Abnormal results
A positive test in a person with symptoms of an
autoimmune or rheumatic disease helps the physician
make a diagnosis. More than 95% of people with SLE
have a positive ANA test. Scleroderma has a 60-71%
positive rate; Sjo¨gren’s disease, 50-60%, and rheumatoid arthritis, 25-30%.
Several factors must be considered when interpreting a positive test. Diseases other than autoimmune diseases can cause autoantibodies. Some
healthy people have a positive test. More testing
is done after a positive test to identify individual
autoantibodies associated with the various diseases.
