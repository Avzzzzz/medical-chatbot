Joint pain is a common medical symptom that can be caused by a variety of conditions.

What causes joint pain?
- Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis, a common type of arthritis, happens over time when your cartilage — the protective cushion between your bones — wears away. Your joints become painful and stiff. Osteoarthritis develops slowly and usually occurs after age 45.
- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA): RA is a chronic disease that causes swelling and pain in your joints. Often, your joints deform (usually occurring in your fingers and wrists).
- Gout: Gout is a painful condition where acidic crystals from your body collect in your joint, causing severe pain and swelling. This usually occurs in your big toe.
- Bursitis: Overuse causes bursitis. It’s usually found in your hip, knee, elbow or shoulder.
- Tendinitis: Tendinitis is inflammation of your tendons — the flexible bands that connect bone and muscle. It’s typically seen in your elbow, heel or shoulder. Overuse often causes it.
