Anxiety is a common medical symptom that can be caused by a variety of conditions.

What causes anxiety?
- Chemical imbalances: Several neurotransmitters and hormones play a role in anxiety, including norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Imbalances in these chemicals can contribute to an anxiety disorder.
- Brain changes: A part of your brain called the amygdala plays an important role in managing fear and anxiety. Studies show that people with anxiety disorders show increased amygdala activity in response to anxiety cues.
- Genetics: Anxiety disorders tend to run in biological families. This suggests that genetics may play a role. You may be at an increased risk of developing one if you have a first-degree relative (biological parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder.
- Environmental factors: Severe or long-lasting stress can change the balance of neurotransmitters that control your mood. Experiencing a lot of stress over a long period can contribute to an anxiety disorder. Experiencing a traumatic event can also trigger anxiety disorders.
