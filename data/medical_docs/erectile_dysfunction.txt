Erectile dysfunction is a common medical symptom that can be caused by a variety of conditions.

What causes erectile dysfunction?
- Circulatory system. Your circulatory system includes the blood vessels that carry blood throughout your body. Your penis needs adequate blood flow to become erect and maintain an erection. Your penis also relies on a series of valves to close when it fills with blood â€” in some cases, these valves stop working as they should.
- Nervous system. Your nervous system includes your brain, spinal cord and nerves. They work together to send electrical impulses that help your body move and feel, including your penis.
- Endocrine system. Your endocrine system includes the glands that create and release hormones. Hormones help tell your body to perform certain functions. Testosterone may help open up (vasodilate) your blood vessels, which helps blood flow to your penis.
