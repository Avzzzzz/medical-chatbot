Sore throat is a common medical symptom that can be caused by a variety of conditions.

What causes sore throat?
- Bacterial infection: Conditions like strep throat and bacterial sinus infections may cause a sore throat.
- Tonsillitis: Tonsillitis occurs when your tonsils become infected and inflamed. Bacteria and viruses can both cause tonsillitis.
- Allergies: Allergic reactions from pollen, dust mites, pets or mold can cause mucus from your nose to drip down the back of your throat (postnasal drip). This can lead to a sore throat.
- Acid reflux: People with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) feel burning and pain in their throats. This pain, called heartburn, happens when acid from your stomach backs up into your food tube (esophagus).
- Overuse or irritants: You can strain your throat by yelling or screaming. You may also develop a sore throat if you eat spicy food, smoke or drink very hot liquids.
- Mouth breathing: You may have a sore throat if you breathe through your mouth instead of your nose when you’re sleeping.
- Tumors: Although a sore throat rarely means cancer, it’s one potential symptom of throat cancer or benign (noncancerous) growths.
