Eye pain is a common medical symptom that can be caused by a variety of conditions.

What causes eye pain?
- Infections: You can transfer viruses, bacteria or fungi from your hands to your eyes when you rub them or put your hands near your eyes. Infections can also spread from areas on your body (like the nose or sinuses) to your eyes.
- Contact lenses: Lenses that are dirty or that don’t fit well can cause pain in your eyes. Wearing contact lenses longer than prescribed (overnight) or not replacing them appropriately can also lead to eye problems. Don’t wear contact lenses that aren’t prescribed for you by your provider.
- Allergies: If you’re allergic to pollen, dust or animals, your eyes can become irritated, itchy and even painful.
- Toxins: Your eyes can become irritated from exposure to cigarette smoke, air pollutants, chlorine in a swimming pool or other types of hazardous chemicals.
- Inflammation: Inflammation, an immune system response, can cause swelling or color changes in your eye. The white part of your eye can turn red, you can become very sensitive to light and your eye can be painful.
- Increased eye pressure: This can happen when the fluid in your eye doesn’t drain properly.
