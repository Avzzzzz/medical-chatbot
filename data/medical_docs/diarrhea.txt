Diarrhea is a common medical symptom that can be caused by a variety of conditions.

What causes diarrhea?
- Infections. Pathogens (viruses, bacteria and parasites) can all cause infections that lead to diarrhea. The most common cause of diarrhea in adults is the norovirus that causes gastroenteritis. Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children.
- Food poisoning. You can ingest harmful toxins and pathogens from contaminated foods or drinks. Once they’re in your gut, the toxins or germs can cause diarrhea. “Traveler’s diarrhea” is when you get diarrhea while traveling in a new environment with poor hygiene or sanitation. Usually, it’s exposure to bacteria that gives you diarrhea.
- Medications. Diarrhea is a common medication side effect. For example, antibiotics kill harmful bacteria that make you sick, but they can destroy helpful bacteria in the process. Not having enough good bacteria can lead to diarrhea. Diarrhea is also a side effect of antacids with magnesium and some cancer drugs and treatments. Overusing laxatives can also cause diarrhea.
- Foods that upset your digestive system. If you’re lactose intolerant, you get diarrhea because your body struggles to digest lactose, the sugar in dairy. Some people have trouble digesting fructose, a sugar in honey and fruits that’s added as a sweetener to some foods. With celiac disease, you get diarrhea because your body has trouble breaking down gluten, a protein in wheat.
- Diseases affecting your bowels. Diarrhea is a common symptom of conditions that cause irritation and inflammation in your bowels (intestines). Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can all cause diarrhea. Stress and anxiety can worsen symptoms if you have a condition like IBS.
- Procedures on your bowels. Many people have diarrhea after surgery on their bowels. It may take a while for your digestive tract to absorb nutrients from the foods you’re eating and create firm stools from the waste.
